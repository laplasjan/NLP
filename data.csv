564,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Kyiv ignores fulfillment ot the Minsk Agreements,"Kyiv forces continue to bomb the territories of the self-proclaimed people's republics of Lugansk and Donetsk (LPR and DPR) this Monday, according to statements released by the missions of the breakaway republics at the Joint Center for Control and Coordination on the ceasefire regime (JCCC).",21/2/2022,Italy,SNA.IT,https://it.sputniknews.com/20220221/le-forze-di-kiev-continuano-i-bombardamenti-riferiscono-lpr-e-dpr---aggiornamenti-15220460.html,"<p>The Minsk agreements were concluded as a result of the Ukrainian army defeats in 2014-2015, so they cannot be considered beneficial for Ukraine. Conditionally, the Minsk provisions can be divided into security and political parts.</p>  
<p>Security</p>  
<p>Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.
<p>Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers. In addition, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russia has not implemented an all-for-all exchange, has not provided humanitarian aid through international mechanisms, has not allowed socio-economic ties to be restored and has not fulfilled a bunch of other points.</p> 
<p>Political part</p> 
<p>First, the agreements themselves do not clearly specify the procedure for implementing the provisions. Therefore, Russia cannot claim that Ukraine must first fulfill the political part – to adopt a special status for Donbas and hold local elections.</p> 
<p> Secondly, Russia claims that Ukraine should give Donbas autonomy. Whereas in Minsk it is only a matter of “special status” – not autonomy.</p> 
<p>The special status for Donbas will give the region significant privileges and make the rest of the regions be in an unequal position. Ukraine must also agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections. These elections must be held under Ukrainian law, which is impossible due to the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, Russia has issued its passports to more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, most of whom left ORDLO, is 1.4 million. And most of them will not be able to vote in the election. As a result, Russia has significantly changed the situation in the ORDLO and stepped up its intervention.</p> "

Conditionally, the Minsk provisions can be divided into security and political parts.</p>  
<p>Security</p>  
<p>Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.
<p>Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers.

<p> Secondly, Russia claims that Ukraine should give Donbas autonomy. Whereas in Minsk it is only a matter of “special status” – not autonomy.</p> 
<p>The special status for Donbas will give the region significant privileges and make the rest of the regions be in an unequal position. Ukraine must also agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections. These elections must be held under Ukrainian law, which is impossible due to the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, Russia has issued its passports to more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, most of whom left ORDLO, is 1.4 million. And most of them will not be able to vote in the election. As a result, Russia has significantly changed the situation in the ORDLO and stepped up its intervention.</p> "

These entities do not provide any evidence of their claims. They are also not confirmed by the data of international observers, namely the OSCE Specialized Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.</p>  
<p>Or they distort the data in the OSCE SMM reports. For example, in April 2021, propagandists reported that a child had died in the Donbas as a result of the Ukrainian drone attack. The mission <a href=""https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/482927"">confirmed</a> the child’s death “as a result of an explosive injury and multiple shrapnel wounds.” There is no information that the child died as a result of a drone strike. And the village of Oleksandrivske, where the incident took place, is in the deep rear of the militants – a drone of the Armed Forces of Ukraine simply could not reach it.</p>
<p>In other cases, the militants referred to the JCCC – Joint Center for Control and Coordination on ceasefire and stabilization of the demarcation line. It was organized in 2014 with the participation of the Ukrainian and Russian military.</p>
<p>But at the end of 2017, Russia withdrew from the JCCC due to new entry rules for Russian officers. Their places in the territories not controlled by Ukraine were taken by militants of the so-called “LDPR”, so their messages cannot be called impartial. Ukraine does not recognize the representatives of the self-proclaimed “republics” as part of the Joint Center, and the EU has called on Russia to <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/9/9/469707.pdf"">return</a> its officers to the JCCC.</p>
<p>In most cases, the ceasefire is violated by Russian occupation forces</p>
<p>On July 27, 2020, the agreement on the establishment of a full and comprehensive ceasefire in Donbas went into effect. Russia claims that Ukraine, ostensibly, does not abide by the terms of the ceasefire. This is not true: the OSCE SMM data proves the opposite. For example, reports for 2021:
in <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/4/1/485378.pdf"">January-March</a>, 98% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control;
in <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/0/0/495784.pdf"">April-June</a>, 93% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control;
in <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/0/0/504544.pdf"">July-September</a>, 87% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control.</p>
<p>The forced evacuation of civilians, which the militants announced in the territories of the so-called “LPR” and “DPR” on February 18, 2021, was a pre-planned operation. According to metadata, a video with “LPR leader” Leonid Pasichnyk about the evacuation was recorded at least two days before its publication on February 16. The video of DNR leader Denis Pushylin with a similar appeal was also recorded on February 16. That is, even before “Ukraine launched an attack” according to Russia.</p>
<p>All this indicates that the reasons for the “evacuation” of the population were invented in advance. Meanwhile, the militants rejected the offer of the Ukrainian side to hold an extraordinary meeting of the Tripartite Contact Group – a group of representatives from Ukraine, the OSCE and Russia, formed for a diplomatic solution to the war in Donbas.</p>"

<p>Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.
<p>Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers. In addition, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russia has not implemented an all-for-all exchange, has not provided humanitarian aid through international mechanisms, has not allowed socio-economic ties to be restored and has not fulfilled a bunch of other points.</p> 
<p>Political part</p> 
<p>First, the agreements themselves do not clearly specify the procedure for implementing the provisions. Therefore, Russia cannot claim that Ukraine must first fulfill the political part – to adopt a special status for Donbas and hold local elections.</p> 
<p> Secondly, Russia claims that Ukraine should give Donbas autonomy. Whereas in Minsk it is only a matter of “special status” – not autonomy.</p> 
<p>The special status for Donbas will give the region significant privileges and make the rest of the regions be in an unequal position. Ukraine must also agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections. These elections must be held under Ukrainian law, which is impossible due to the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, Russia has issued its passports to more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, most of whom left ORDLO, is 1.4 million. And most of them will not be able to vote in the election. As a result, Russia has significantly changed the situation in the ORDLO and stepped up its intervention.</p> "

<p>In 2015, Igor Strelkov (Girkin), a leader in the operation of taking over Crimea, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICgazA79a2g&ab_channel=HalahanValerii"">admitted</a> that the deputies had to be “herded” into the Parliament to vote on February 27.</p>
<p>Two questions were <a href=""http://crimea.gov.ru/act/11689"">put up</a> for the referendum: “Do you support the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation?” and “Do you support the restoration of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea as of 1992 and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?” None of them provided for the possibility of maintaining the status quo. </p>
<p> <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/krym/show/rb076a002-92"">Crimea’s Constitution as of 1992</a> provided broad autonomy rights for the peninsula. As if it were a separate state having its governing bodies and “exercising in its territory all of its powers except those voluntarily delegated to Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The “referendum” was also illegitimate from the point of view of Ukrainian laws. According to Article 73 of Ukraine’s Constitution, the issue of changing the territory is decided only at an all-Ukrainian referendum. Whether Crimea should be part of Ukraine had to be agreed upon by all the regions, and the voting of people in Crimea alone was not enough for such a decision.</p>
<p>In truth, the Crimean “referendum” took place without international observers who could document violations. However, Crimean journalists and voters have repeatedly <a href=""https://crimea.suspilne.media/ua/articles/45""> stated</a>  that ballots were distributed in a massive way to the same people. They were also given to people with Russian passports.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Venice Commission unanimously adopted an  <a href=""https://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2014)002-e"">opinion</a> viewing the referendum in Crimea as unlawful and violating, besides the Constitution of Ukraine, basic international principles regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty of subjects of international law.</p>
<p>Neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor the United States recognized the results of Crimea’s “referendum.” On March 27, 2021, <a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464812-backing-ukraines-territorial-integrity-un-assembly-declares-crimea-referendum"">passed</a> a resolution to support Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

560,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Kyiv ignores fulfillment ot the Minsk Agreements,Russia is not ruling out that the hysteria around Ukraine created by the West aims to cover up Kiev's intentions to avoid implementing the Minsk agreements on the Donbass.,13/02/2022,Italy,SNA.IT,https://it.sputniknews.com/20220213/nato-vicina-al-dispiegamento-di-ununita-da-combattimento-permanente-in-romania-15092381.html,"<p>The Minsk agreements were concluded as a result of the Ukrainian army defeats in 2014-2015, so they cannot be considered beneficial for Ukraine. Conditionally, the Minsk provisions can be divided into security and political parts.</p>  
<p>Security</p>  
<p>Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.
<p>Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers. In addition, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russia has not implemented an all-for-all exchange, has not provided humanitarian aid through international mechanisms, has not allowed socio-economic ties to be restored and has not fulfilled a bunch of other points.</p> 
<p>Political part</p> 
<p>First, the agreements themselves do not clearly specify the procedure for implementing the provisions. Therefore, Russia cannot claim that Ukraine must first fulfill the political part – to adopt a special status for Donbas and hold local elections.</p> 
<p> Secondly, Russia claims that Ukraine should give Donbas autonomy. Whereas in Minsk it is only a matter of “special status” – not autonomy.</p> 
<p>The special status for Donbas will give the region significant privileges and make the rest of the regions be in an unequal position. Ukraine must also agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections. These elections must be held under Ukrainian law, which is impossible due to the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, Russia has issued its passports to more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, most of whom left ORDLO, is 1.4 million. And most of them will not be able to vote in the election. As a result, Russia has significantly changed the situation in the ORDLO and stepped up its intervention.</p> "

NATO did not surround Russia and did not plan to deploy Allied forces in the eastern part of the Alliance until Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea. Multinational battle groups in the Baltic states and Poland were deployed in 2016 in response to Russia’s use of military force against its neighbors. These forces are rotational, defensive and proportional. NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. Each sovereign state has the right to choose its own security mechanisms and to join regional defense alliances for self-defense. This is a fundamental principle of European security, reflected in the UN Charter, and one that Russia has reaffirmed in many international and regional instruments, such as the Helsinki Final Act.</p> "

About two hours after the crash, one of the militant leaders, Igor Girkin (Strelkov), the “DPR’s” defense minister, published a report that the “DPR” had shot down a Ukrainian AN-26 aircraft near Torez. However, when it became known that it was not a Ukrainian military plane that was shot down, but a passenger plane, Girkin deleted his post.

A version of the downing of the plane from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system was formed on the basis of these conversations.
Independent Bellingcat investigators found that Buk anti-aircraft missile system was transported to the “DPR” from Russia. They confirmed this information with intercepted conversations, satellite photos and social media posts. The Buk which shot down the plane <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/"">belonged</a> to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Army from Kursk.</p>

<p>JIT investigators <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G"">have named</a> four people involved in the downing of a Malaysian Boeing in June 2019. According to the investigation, Igor Girkin, a former “DPR” defense minister, Oleg Pulatov, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian Airborne Forces, Sergey Dubinsky, a retired GRU officer, Leonid Kharchenko, a commander of the intelligence unit at “GRU DPR”, a Ukrainian. The first three suspects at the time of the JIT statement were in Russia, and Kharchenko was in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine. All four are suspect of organizing the supply of anti-aircraft missile system.</p> 
<p>Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shooting down a Boeing and tried to provide its “evidence”. However, all this is a lie.

<p>The Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that MH17 was shot down by a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. It is not true.</p> 
<p>First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17. Experiments confirm that the Su-25 can rise to an altitude of 10,000 km, but without weapons.</p> 
<p>Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17. This was <a href=""https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/krieg-in-der-ukraine-mh-17-wurde-vom-boden-aus-abgeschossen-1.2386385"">stated</a> by one of the designers of the Su-25 Vladimir Babak and the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">editor of the military magazine</a> HS Jane’s Defense Weekly Nick de Larrinaga.</p> 
<p>Third, around 800 pieces of shrapnel <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">had ripped</a> through MH17. This confirms that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, not an air-to-air missile with much less power.

<p>Russia has called the investigation biased and partial, but has refused to cooperate with other countries.

<p>The main goal of the coup d’etat is to seize power by conspirators in conformity with their own interests. The Revolution of Dignity began with actions in support of the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU – Euromaidan – and later evolved into mass protests aimed at protecting human and civil rights and freedoms, democratic values. Power and profit have never been its goal. The result of the revolution was the ratification of the Agreement with the EU and the holding of fair presidential and parliamentary elections.</p> 
<p>The conspiracy presupposes the presence of a small group of people and is in no way a mass phenomenon.</p>
<p>According to a <a href=""https://dif.org.ua/article/richnitsya-maydanu-opituvannya-gromadskoi-ta-ekspertnoi-dumki"">sociological  poll</a> conducted in October 2014 by the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation for Democratic Initiatives, about 20% of Ukraine’s population, more than 8.5 million people, took part in peaceful rallies. The poll showed that most citizens perceived participating in the protests as a conscious struggle for their rights.</p> 
<p>Other signs of a coup d’etat are unconstitutionality and violence, when weapons are the main tool to achieve the goal. All the events of the Revolution of Dignity took place in a constitutional manner, and the protesters began to use self-defense only after the escalation of violence by the authorities, which involved armed security forces to disperse unarmed protesters.</p>"

149,Russia needs to protect itself,The West is provoking a war with Russia ,"Over the weekend, the fake Biden allegedly met with his national security team at Camp David, a fake news statement, saying: They are ""discussing (ing) the continuing Russian aggression against Ukraine"" - which in reality do not exist. The alleged ""state of Russian military operations"" along the border with Ukraine is hundreds of kilometers away on Russian territory and does not threaten anyone. … 
Hot and Cold Wars are long-standing US-dominated NATO actions against made-up enemies
In stark contrast, Russia's geopolitical agenda prioritizes cooperative relations with other nations over the war confrontation it avoids. The so-called ""information"" mentioned by Truss is pre-fabricated, without being able to deceive anyone. They are part of the pre-war propaganda of Washington and NATO. In league with the hegemonic US, this is part of Britain's war against Russia by other means.

<p>NATO has not threatened Russia. On the contrary, for many years, the alliance has <a href=""https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/115204.htm"">offered</a> cooperation to Russia. Back in 2000-2010, the parties managed to cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking, international terrorism, and in the field of emergency response.
However, Russia has undermined the alliance’s confidence at least twice: by Russian aggression against Georgia in 2008 and against Ukraine in 2014.</p>"

522,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Ukraine builds up military forces in Donbas,"A central reason for the escalation, however, is that the Kiev government has progressively enhanced its army and military arsenal with active American support, with the production of its own weapons and, ultimately, with the purchase of Turkish drones, which have already proved essential for Azerbaijan's lightning-fast victory over Armenia in September 2020 in Nagorno-Karabach.",22/01/2022,Italy,huffingtonpost.it,https://www.huffingtonpost.it/guest/luiss-school-of-government/2022/01/22/news/perche_la_crisi_in_ucraina_adesso_puo_scatenare_una_guerra_in_europa-7552226/,"<p>Russia was the first to mobilize  its troops to Ukraine’s borders – without any threat from Ukraine</p>  
<p>In December 2021, Russian politicians, including President Putin and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, claimed that Ukraine had moved half of its army (or 120,000 to 125,000 troops) to the war zone. They did not release any confirmation of the mentioned data.</p>
<p>Data on the number of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are regularly published on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The information is also available in the passports of budget programs exposed for public access. In December 2021, there were more than 201,000 servicemen in the Armed Forces. Just over 40,000 of them took part in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). That is three times less than what was said in Russia. For comparison, in February 2021, just over 40,000 servicemen took part in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). Almost a year before, in May 2020 there had been the same number – 40 thousand.</p>
<p>The number of Ukrainian servicemen in Donbas did not increase. Instead, in October-November 2021, Russia, according to various estimates, drew about 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s borders.
There is no evidence, in particular from independent observers, that Kyiv was going to attack Donbas</p>
<p>In the autumn of 2021, Russia once again declared that Ukraine was preparing for the “offensive in Donbas.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation announced offensive actions of the Armed Forces in the area of ​​Granitny and Staromaryivka (Donetsk region), referring to the reports of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.
This is not true: the Mission’s daily reports did not mention this. Instead, OSCE SMM reports during this period revealed the systemic restrictions on freedom of movement in the temporarily occupied territories (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505267"">for example, here</a>), blocking of communications and surveillance (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505276"">here</a>), threats to the personal security of international observers by Russian armed forces (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/512884"">here</a>)</p>
<p>The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not open fire first and do not shell civilians and infrastructure in Donbas</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Armed Forces first used the Turkish Bayraktar drone in October 2021. The parties have banned the use of UAVs in the context of a truce signed in July 2020 within the Tripartite Contact Group. The first paragraph states a “ban on the use of any type of aircraft.” But there is also a ban on any “use of fire, including sniper fire” – and this point is constantly being neglected by the Russian occupation forces.</p>
<p>Bayraktar was used as a last resort. The militants fired from 122-mm howitzers prohibited by the Minsk agreements on civilian targets and positions of the Armed Forces near Granitny in the Donetsk region for several days. In addition, Russian mercenaries dropped explosive devices with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle.</p>
<p>The militants did not stop the shelling even after the Ukrainian side used a standard response mechanism: the OSCE SMM called for a ceasefire. And under the terms of the July 2020 truce, retaliatory fire is allowed in the event of a failed response.
Ukraine did not violate the Minsk agreements: Bayraktar did not cross the contact line, the howitzer was destroyed by a guided missile.</p>
<p>In addition, the first drones in Donbas were, in fact, used by militants: Russian UAVs “Orlan-10” <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sergiy.garmash/posts/3854732251293562"">have long been recorded</a> in Donbas.</p>
<p>The West did not “pump Ukraine with weapons”, but provided weapons to repel a possible Russian attack</p>
<p>The bulk of the weapons received by Ukraine are anti-tank systems (NLAW, Javelin), which make little sense in the event of the attack of the Armed Forces on uncontrolled territories, but are necessary in the event of an attack by armored vehicles from the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Russia has been supporting separatists in Donbas since 2014, supplying them with modern weapons, heavy weapons, troops and training. This has been repeatedly <a href=""https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_117496.htm?selectedLocale=uk"">confirmed</a> by NATO, Ukrainian and American <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/25463277.html"">intelligence</a></p>"
521,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Kyiv intends to resolve the conflict in Donbas by force,"It is plausible, that is, that Moscow fears that the Kiev government will soon try to, and have the ability to, reconquer the territories currently in the hands of the separatists. ",22/01/2022,Italy,huffingtonpost.it,https://www.huffingtonpost.it/guest/luiss-school-of-government/2022/01/22/news/perche_la_crisi_in_ucraina_adesso_puo_scatenare_una_guerra_in_europa-7552226/,"<p>In  March, 2021, Russia began to reinforce its military presence along the Ukrainian border in the north, east and south. Then in the Bryansk, Voronezh, Rostov regions and on the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea, the Russian Federation deployed 28 battalion tactical groups put on wartime alert. Troops were recruited under the disguise of military exercises. By May, the Ukrainian government had <a href=""https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-defense/3254285-ukraine-tells-osce-about-number-of-Russian-troops-on-border-and-in-crimea.html"">estimated</a> that Russia had concentrated up to 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders and in the occupied Crimea.
Moscow, meanwhile, claimed it was responding to Kyiv’s provocations aimed at escalating the Donbas conflict. According to observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), there were no provocations.</p>
<p>Moreover, before Russia’s moving of troops to Ukraine’s borders in the spring of 2021, it were Russian-controlled militants, who had increased the number of shellings and heavy weapons which they, on the contrary, were to withdraw.</p>
<p>Thus, the number of ceasefire violations in early 2021 increased. But the vast majority of these violations were committed by militants, not Ukrainian troops. The <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/f/9/485372.pdf"">observations</a> of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine for January-March 2021 state: 98% of the total number of ceasefire violations were recorded in areas not controlled by the Ukrainian government. The mission recorded more than 500 weapons deployed in violation of agreed withdrawal lines. About 95% of them are in territories not under Ukraine’s control.</p>
Representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stressed since 2014 that they are not considering a forceful scenario for the return of the occupied Donbas. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine did not plan any offensive operations in Donbas. The only possible means declared were political and diplomatic.</p>
<p>shortly before Russia’s full-scale attack. on Ukraine, propaganda media reported that Volodymyr Zelensky had ordered to invade Donbas. In fact, Zelensky has never made such statements. Such a decree did not appear neither on the <a href=""https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/decrees?s-num=&contain-rule=contains&s-text=&date-from=01-01-2021&date-to=01-03-2022&order=asc&"">website</a> of the President of Ukraine nor in official publications, in which, according to Ukrainian law, this act had to be published.
The US State Department <a href=""https://www.state.gov/fact-vs-fiction-Russian-disinformation-on-ukraine/"">stressed</a> that Russian military and intelligence agencies are misinforming the world about the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attack on Donbas in order to portray Ukraine and Ukrainian officials as aggressors. In the same mold, Russia occupied part of Georgia in 2008 and did not withdraw its troops and ammunition from Moldova, where they still remain without government consent.</p>
<p>Data on the number of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are regularly published on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In <a href=""https://www.mil.gov.ua/content/mou_orders/mou_2021/372_nm.pdf"">December 2021</a>, there were more than 201,000 servicemen in the Armed Forces. Slightly more than 40,000 of them took part in the Joint Forces (JFO) operation in Donbas. So, clearly, not half of the army of Ukraine.
As for the Minsk agreements, it is Russia which has not yet ensured the implementation of security points. Nor has it implemented the  measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020.</p>"

Moscow strictly adheres to the Minsk agreements and therefore regards the Donbas as an integral part of neighboring Ukraine, which, however, must be granted autonomy.

Moreover, the official Kyiv did not hide it, on the contrary it boasted. Not long ago, current President Volodymyr Zelensky admitted committing such operations, and his predecessor Petro Poroshenko generally claimed that he personally ""ordered and authorized dozens of operations to eliminate Ukraine's invaders and enemies."" Therefore, the CIA-trained Ukrainian saboteurs are capable of any terrorist attack. This means that it is necessary to respond with triple vigilance to the provocation scenarios expressed in the White House, not perceiving them only as another anti-Russian bluff.Behind those could be truly dire plans to drag Russia into the Ukrainian conflict.",17/01/2022,Italy,Controinformazione,https://www.controinformazione.info/la-stessa-ucraina-non-crede-in-uninvasione-russa-ma-la-cia-ha-altri-piani/,"<p>First, there is no need to involve Russia in the so-called “Ukrainian conflict” because Russia is its aggressor.

In 2021, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was the first to report on “chemical weapons in the Donbas.” Later, the leader of the so-called “DPR” Denis Pushylin picked up this information flow. The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine called it disinformation, and the US State Department also <a href=""https://twitter.com/StateDeptSpox/status/1473444488337293313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1473444488337293313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radiosvoboda.org%2Fa%2Fnews-pentagon-shoygu%2F31620567.html"">denied</a> it.</p>

<p>There is no reason to claim that Ukraine was preparing to attack Donbas
Since 2014 the representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stressed that they are not considering a forceful scenario to return the occupied Donbas. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine did not  plan any offensive operations in Donbas.

These forces are rotational, defensive and proportional. NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia.

No matter how much Russia justified its actions, in 2014 it was it that started the war in eastern Ukraine and occupied Crimea. It was Russia that systematically violated the Minsk agreements during the 8 years of the hybrid war.</p> 
<p>NATO, in turn, has repeatedly <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-nato-ukraina/31678391.html"">stated</a> that it will not send troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian attack. All members of the Alliance confirmed at the Brussels Summit in June 2021 that “the Alliance does not seek confrontation and does not pose a threat to Russia.”</p>
<p>In January 2022, amid Russia’s disinformation about the border situation, the US Secretary of State’s Office <a href=""https://www.state.gov/fact-vs-fiction-Russian-disinformation-on-ukraine/"">issued</a> a disproof, including on NATO’s plans. NATO did not surround Russia and did not plan to deploy Allied forces in the eastern part of the Alliance until Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea. Multinational battle groups in the Baltic states and Poland were deployed in 2016 in response to Russia’s use of military force against its neighbors. These forces are rotational, defensive and proportional. NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. Each sovereign state has the right to choose its own security mechanisms and to join regional defense alliances for self-defense. This is a fundamental principle of European security, reflected in the UN Charter, and one that Russia has reaffirmed in many international and regional instruments, such as the Helsinki Final Act.</p> "

Further, we present the main theses:
1. When they talk about “historically Russian” lands, they mostly talk about the South of Ukraine, Slobozhanshchyna, and Donbas, which were formed on the territory of the uninhabited Dyke Pole (Wild Field).
2. On the map of 1720, Putin’s “historically Russian” lands belong to either Ukraine or the Crimean Khanate.
3. More than 100 years later, the 1897 census of the Russian Empire showed that the so-called “Little Russian” (i.e., Ukrainian) language dominates not only in modern Ukraine (particularly in the “historically Russian” lands mentioned by Putin) but also goes beyond it.
4. The “similarity” of languages ​​and religions was created artificially by Russia: in 1720, Peter I ordered the publication of books only in Russian, and in 1863 Peter Valuev almost completely banned all printing in Ukrainian; Ukrainians tried to establish their own church as early as 1302, as evidenced by the existence of the Galician Metropolis, abolished by the pressure of Moscow’s Tsar Simeon the Proud in 1347.</p>"

Then in the Bryansk, Voronezh, Rostov regions and on the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea, the Russian Federation deployed 28 battalion tactical groups put on wartime alert. Troops were recruited under the disguise of military exercises. By May, the Ukrainian government had <a href=""https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-defense/3254285-ukraine-tells-osce-about-number-of-Russian-troops-on-border-and-in-crimea.html"">estimated</a> that Russia had concentrated up to 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders and in the occupied Crimea.
Moscow, meanwhile, claimed it was responding to Kyiv’s provocations aimed at escalating the Donbas conflict. According to observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), there were no provocations.</p>
<p>Moreover, before Russia’s moving of troops to Ukraine’s borders in the spring of 2021, it were Russian-controlled militants, who had increased the number of shellings and heavy weapons which they, on the contrary, were to withdraw.</p>
<p>Thus, the number of ceasefire violations in early 2021 increased. But the vast majority of these violations were committed by militants, not Ukrainian troops. The <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/f/9/485372.pdf"">observations</a> of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine for January-March 2021 state: 98% of the total number of ceasefire violations were recorded in areas not controlled by the Ukrainian government. The mission recorded more than 500 weapons deployed in violation of agreed withdrawal lines. About 95% of them are in territories not under Ukraine’s control.</p>
Representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stressed since 2014 that they are not considering a forceful scenario for the return of the occupied Donbas. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine did not plan any offensive operations in Donbas. The only possible means declared were political and diplomatic.</p>
<p>shortly before Russia’s full-scale attack. on Ukraine, propaganda media reported that Volodymyr Zelensky had ordered to invade Donbas. In fact, Zelensky has never made such statements. Such a decree did not appear neither on the <a href=""https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/decrees?s-num=&contain-rule=contains&s-text=&date-from=01-01-2021&date-to=01-03-2022&order=asc&"">website</a> of the President of Ukraine nor in official publications, in which, according to Ukrainian law, this act had to be published.
The US State Department <a href=""https://www.state.gov/fact-vs-fiction-Russian-disinformation-on-ukraine/"">stressed</a> that Russian military and intelligence agencies are misinforming the world about the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attack on Donbas in order to portray Ukraine and Ukrainian officials as aggressors. In the same mold, Russia occupied part of Georgia in 2008 and did not withdraw its troops and ammunition from Moldova, where they still remain without government consent.</p>

Slightly more than 40,000 of them took part in the Joint Forces (JFO) operation in Donbas. So, clearly, not half of the army of Ukraine.
As for the Minsk agreements, it is Russia which has not yet ensured the implementation of security points. Nor has it implemented the  measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020.</p>"

<p>After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power.

382,Russia is not an agressor towards Ukraine,Russia did not occupy Crimea. It was a reunification,"Nobody pays attention to the fact, as reported by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, that ""on March 16, 2014, Crimea held a referendum in which 97 percent of voters chose to leave Ukraine and join Russia."" But Washington's orders were clear to Western countries and they dismissed the measure as illegal.",22/12/2021,Italy,Controinformazione,https://www.controinformazione.info/la-crimea-e-calma-il-che-sconvolge-la-nato-perche-preferisce-il-confronto/,"<p>The decision to hold a so-called “referendum” was made at a session of the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea on February 27, 2014. By then, the military without insignia had already seized the parliament building. Journalists were not allowed into the hall. Whether there was a quorum for making this decision and how the MPs voted under the barrels of guns is unknown. </p>
<p>In 2015, Igor Strelkov (Girkin), a leader in the operation of taking over Crimea, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICgazA79a2g&ab_channel=HalahanValerii"">admitted</a> that the deputies had to be “herded” into the Parliament to vote on February 27.</p>
<p>Two questions were <a href=""http://crimea.gov.ru/act/11689"">put up</a> for the referendum: “Do you support the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation?” and “Do you support the restoration of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea as of 1992 and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?” None of them provided for the possibility of maintaining the status quo. </p>
<p> <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/krym/show/rb076a002-92"">Crimea’s Constitution as of 1992</a> provided broad autonomy rights for the peninsula. As if it were a separate state having its governing bodies and “exercising in its territory all of its powers except those voluntarily delegated to Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The “referendum” was also illegitimate from the point of view of Ukrainian laws. According to Article 73 of Ukraine’s Constitution, the issue of changing the territory is decided only at an all-Ukrainian referendum. Whether Crimea should be part of Ukraine had to be agreed upon by all the regions, and the voting of people in Crimea alone was not enough for such a decision.</p>
<p>In truth, the Crimean “referendum” took place without international observers who could document violations. However, Crimean journalists and voters have repeatedly <a href=""https://crimea.suspilne.media/ua/articles/45""> stated</a>  that ballots were distributed in a massive way to the same people. They were also given to people with Russian passports.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Venice Commission unanimously adopted an  <a href=""https://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2014)002-e"">opinion</a> viewing the referendum in Crimea as unlawful and violating, besides the Constitution of Ukraine, basic international principles regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty of subjects of international law.</p>
<p>Neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor the United States recognized the results of Crimea’s “referendum.” On March 27, 2021, <a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464812-backing-ukraines-territorial-integrity-un-assembly-declares-crimea-referendum"">passed</a> a resolution to support Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

They opened fire from the occupied territories of Ukraine and Russia.</p>  
<p> However, they failed to stop the Armed Forces’ offensive.

<p>After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power.

By then, the military without insignia had already seized the parliament building. Journalists were not allowed into the hall. Whether there was a quorum for making this decision and how the MPs voted under the barrels of guns is unknown. </p>
<p>In 2015, Igor Strelkov (Girkin), a leader in the operation of taking over Crimea, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICgazA79a2g&ab_channel=HalahanValerii"">admitted</a> that the deputies had to be “herded” into the Parliament to vote on February 27.</p>
<p>Two questions were <a href=""http://crimea.gov.ru/act/11689"">put up</a> for the referendum: “Do you support the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation?” and “Do you support the restoration of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea as of 1992 and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?” None of them provided for the possibility of maintaining the status quo. </p>
<p> <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/krym/show/rb076a002-92"">Crimea’s Constitution as of 1992</a> provided broad autonomy rights for the peninsula. As if it were a separate state having its governing bodies and “exercising in its territory all of its powers except those voluntarily delegated to Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The “referendum” was also illegitimate from the point of view of Ukrainian laws. According to Article 73 of Ukraine’s Constitution, the issue of changing the territory is decided only at an all-Ukrainian referendum. Whether Crimea should be part of Ukraine had to be agreed upon by all the regions, and the voting of people in Crimea alone was not enough for such a decision.</p>
<p>In truth, the Crimean “referendum” took place without international observers who could document violations. However, Crimean journalists and voters have repeatedly <a href=""https://crimea.suspilne.media/ua/articles/45""> stated</a>  that ballots were distributed in a massive way to the same people. They were also given to people with Russian passports.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Venice Commission unanimously adopted an  <a href=""https://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2014)002-e"">opinion</a> viewing the referendum in Crimea as unlawful and violating, besides the Constitution of Ukraine, basic international principles regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty of subjects of international law.</p>
<p>Neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor the United States recognized the results of Crimea’s “referendum.” On March 27, 2021, <a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464812-backing-ukraines-territorial-integrity-un-assembly-declares-crimea-referendum"">passed</a> a resolution to support Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

Then in the Bryansk, Voronezh, Rostov regions and on the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea, the Russian Federation deployed 28 battalion tactical groups put on wartime alert. Troops were recruited under the disguise of military exercises. By May, the Ukrainian government had <a href=""https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-defense/3254285-ukraine-tells-osce-about-number-of-Russian-troops-on-border-and-in-crimea.html"">estimated</a> that Russia had concentrated up to 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders and in the occupied Crimea.
Moscow, meanwhile, claimed it was responding to Kyiv’s provocations aimed at escalating the Donbas conflict. According to observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), there were no provocations.</p>
<p>Moreover, before Russia’s moving of troops to Ukraine’s borders in the spring of 2021, it were Russian-controlled militants, who had increased the number of shellings and heavy weapons which they, on the contrary, were to withdraw.</p>
<p>Thus, the number of ceasefire violations in early 2021 increased. But the vast majority of these violations were committed by militants, not Ukrainian troops. The <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/f/9/485372.pdf"">observations</a> of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine for January-March 2021 state: 98% of the total number of ceasefire violations were recorded in areas not controlled by the Ukrainian government. The mission recorded more than 500 weapons deployed in violation of agreed withdrawal lines. About 95% of them are in territories not under Ukraine’s control.</p>
Representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stressed since 2014 that they are not considering a forceful scenario for the return of the occupied Donbas. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine did not plan any offensive operations in Donbas. The only possible means declared were political and diplomatic.</p>
<p>shortly before Russia’s full-scale attack. on Ukraine, propaganda media reported that Volodymyr Zelensky had ordered to invade Donbas. In fact, Zelensky has never made such statements. Such a decree did not appear neither on the <a href=""https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/decrees?s-num=&contain-rule=contains&s-text=&date-from=01-01-2021&date-to=01-03-2022&order=asc&"">website</a> of the President of Ukraine nor in official publications, in which, according to Ukrainian law, this act had to be published.
The US State Department <a href=""https://www.state.gov/fact-vs-fiction-Russian-disinformation-on-ukraine/"">stressed</a> that Russian military and intelligence agencies are misinforming the world about the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attack on Donbas in order to portray Ukraine and Ukrainian officials as aggressors. In the same mold, Russia occupied part of Georgia in 2008 and did not withdraw its troops and ammunition from Moldova, where they still remain without government consent.</p>
<p>Data on the number of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are regularly published on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In <a href=""https://www.mil.gov.ua/content/mou_orders/mou_2021/372_nm.pdf"">December 2021</a>, there were more than 201,000 servicemen in the Armed Forces. Slightly more than 40,000 of them took part in the Joint Forces (JFO) operation in Donbas. So, clearly, not half of the army of Ukraine.
As for the Minsk agreements, it is Russia which has not yet ensured the implementation of security points. Nor has it implemented the  measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020.</p>"

<p>In March 2014, there were rallies in Donetsk and Luhansk: in favor of joining Russia and uniting with Ukraine. Local witnesses said people had been brought from the Russian border to participate in pro-Russian rallies.</p> 
<p>In April, armed men (local and Russian citizens) began to capture city authorities in the Donbas region. According to a Radio Liberty <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/31380909.html"">investigation</a>, Russian army officers led the operations. The separatists proclaimed the so-called “DPR” on April 7, 2014, and the “LPR” on April 27, 2014.</p>

They opened fire from the occupied territories of Ukraine and Russia.</p>  
<p> However, they failed to stop the Armed Forces’ offensive. The Kremlin sent 4,000 regular army soldiers to Donbas in August 2014, an Atlantic Council <a href=""https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/191186/HPS_RW_Russian_0713_final_web.pdf"">report</a> said.

<p> In February 2014, the same Verkhovna Rada that had operated under fugitive president Viktor Yanukovych (not the “West”) appointed the new government.</p> 
<p>After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power. Based on this, it appointed Oleksandr Turchynov President of Ukraine, on February 23.

Former Interior Minister Arsen Avakov has a similar opinion: ""It shows that the Ukrainian government has lost its role as an actor in the eyes of world leaders,"" he commented on the situation when Zelensky became the last head of state after Biden's talks with Vladimir Putin was that Joe Biden spoke to.",28/12/2021,Germany,Antispiegel,https://www.anti-spiegel.ru/2021/spielball-der-weltpolitik-was-erwartete-die-ukraine-in-2022/,"<p>Economic relations with Russia have indeed become much colder since Russian troops invaded Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and occupied Crimea. <a href=""https://ukrstat.org/uk/express/expr2013/03_13/55.zip"">According</a> <a href=""http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/express/expr2022/02/14.pdf"">to the State Statistics Service</a>, when in 2013, 25.6% of all exports were to Russia, in 2021 – 5%.

Conditionally, the Minsk provisions can be divided into security and political parts.</p>  
<p>Security</p>  
<p>Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.
<p>Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers. In addition, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russia has not implemented an all-for-all exchange, has not provided humanitarian aid through international mechanisms, has not allowed socio-economic ties to be restored and has not fulfilled a bunch of other points.</p> 
<p>Political part</p> 
<p>First, the agreements themselves do not clearly specify the procedure for implementing the provisions. Therefore, Russia cannot claim that Ukraine must first fulfill the political part – to adopt a special status for Donbas and hold local elections.</p> 
<p> Secondly, Russia claims that Ukraine should give Donbas autonomy. Whereas in Minsk it is only a matter of “special status” – not autonomy.</p> 
<p>The special status for Donbas will give the region significant privileges and make the rest of the regions be in an unequal position. Ukraine must also agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections. These elections must be held under Ukrainian law, which is impossible due to the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, Russia has issued its passports to more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, most of whom left ORDLO, is 1.4 million. And most of them will not be able to vote in the election. As a result, Russia has significantly changed the situation in the ORDLO and stepped up its intervention.</p> "

The owner is Gazprom , which has invested 9.5 billion euros in the project, half of its value. The rest of the costs were financed by the British oil and gas company Shell, the Austrian OMV, the French Engie and the German Uniper and Wintershall DEA. The launch of Nord Stream 2 was aimed at doubling gas pumping capacity from Russia to Germany, bypassing other countries’ gas pipelines, which would <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-eu-energy-nordstream-idUKKCN0WI1YV?edition-redirect=uk"">violate</a> EU competition principles and deepen Russia’s monopoly on gas supplies to Europe.</p>

<p> However, they failed to stop the Armed Forces’ offensive.

Conditionally, the Minsk provisions can be divided into security and political parts.</p>  
<p>Security</p>  
<p>Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.
<p>Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers. In addition, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russia has not implemented an all-for-all exchange, has not provided humanitarian aid through international mechanisms, has not allowed socio-economic ties to be restored and has not fulfilled a bunch of other points.</p> 
<p>Political part</p> 
<p>First, the agreements themselves do not clearly specify the procedure for implementing the provisions. Therefore, Russia cannot claim that Ukraine must first fulfill the political part – to adopt a special status for Donbas and hold local elections.</p> 
<p> Secondly, Russia claims that Ukraine should give Donbas autonomy. Whereas in Minsk it is only a matter of “special status” – not autonomy.</p> 
<p>The special status for Donbas will give the region significant privileges and make the rest of the regions be in an unequal position. Ukraine must also agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections. These elections must be held under Ukrainian law, which is impossible due to the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, Russia has issued its passports to more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, most of whom left ORDLO, is 1.4 million. And most of them will not be able to vote in the election. As a result, Russia has significantly changed the situation in the ORDLO and stepped up its intervention.</p> "

<p>Second, there is no evidence from independent observers (including the OSCE SMM, which worked directly in the region) that Kyiv has resorted to terrorist attacks or sabotage in the Donbas. As well as the fact that other countries, including the United States, may have been involved.</p> 
<p>With “chemical attacks” Russia has intimidated the population of Donbas for years, at least since 2018. In 2021, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was the first to report on “chemical weapons in the Donbas.” Later, the leader of the so-called “DPR” Denis Pushylin picked up this information flow. The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine called it disinformation, and the US State Department also <a href=""https://twitter.com/StateDeptSpox/status/1473444488337293313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1473444488337293313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radiosvoboda.org%2Fa%2Fnews-pentagon-shoygu%2F31620567.html"">denied</a> it.</p>

<p>There is no reason to claim that Ukraine was preparing to attack Donbas
Since 2014 the representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stressed that they are not considering a forceful scenario to return the occupied Donbas. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine did not  plan any offensive operations in Donbas. Whereas the only acceptable means to do so would be political and diplomatic.

431,Russia is not an agressor towards Ukraine,"Conflict in Eastern Ukraine is solely internal, i.e, a civil war","Russia has repeatedly denounced the fact that the major Western powers, in particular France and Germany, have repeatedly rejected the conditions for a possible lasting peace agreement.

<p>In March 2014, there were rallies in Donetsk and Luhansk: in favor of joining Russia and uniting with Ukraine. Local witnesses said people had been brought from the Russian border to participate in pro-Russian rallies.</p> 
<p>In April, armed men (local and Russian citizens) began to capture city authorities in the Donbas region. According to a Radio Liberty <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/31380909.html"">investigation</a>, Russian army officers led the operations. The separatists proclaimed the so-called “DPR” on April 7, 2014, and the “LPR” on April 27, 2014.</p>  
<p>According to a Bellingcat <a href=""https://ru.bellingcat.com/novosti/ukraine/2016/12/21/putins-undeclared-war-summer-2014-Russian-artillery-strikes-against-ukraine/"">investigation</a>, military units liquidated all Ukrainian authorities in the occupied territories in April and May and began shelling Ukrainian cities with heavy artillery. They opened fire from the occupied territories of Ukraine and Russia.</p>  
<p> However, they failed to stop the Armed Forces’ offensive. The Kremlin sent 4,000 regular army soldiers to Donbas in August 2014, an Atlantic Council <a href=""https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/191186/HPS_RW_Russian_0713_final_web.pdf"">report</a> said.

The Russian military took an active part in the fighting, and their intervention turned the tide of the battle.</p>  
<p>According to Ukrainian intelligence reports, at least <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/amp/donbas-realii/29721302.html?fbclid=IwAR0DxGV2Tt6r_TGZz2VihZAiNdc7cdwrw6QWrODSBpo4VX6Kp2AKZKJl0ro"">11 Russian generals</a> commanded the “troops” made up of the DNR and LNR groups.</p> 
<p> In February 2014, the same Verkhovna Rada that had operated under fugitive president Viktor Yanukovych (not the “West”) appointed the new government.</p> 
<p>After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power. Based on this, it appointed Oleksandr Turchynov President of Ukraine, on February 23. The then convocation of Verkhovna Rada <a href=""https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/247059910"">voted</a> for the new government and prime minister on February 27.

Although formally owned by the Ukrainian Navy, the actual owners are ""handlers"" from the United States.

Western officials and media speculated about Moscow's plans to partially or totally invade Ukraine.",09/12/2021,Italy,SNA.IT,https://it.sputniknews.com/20211209/putin-quello-che-accade-nel-donbass-assomiglia-a-un-genocidio-14125613.html,"<p>In  March, 2021, Russia began to reinforce its military presence along the Ukrainian border in the north, east and south. Then in the Bryansk, Voronezh, Rostov regions and on the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea, the Russian Federation deployed 28 battalion tactical groups put on wartime alert. Troops were recruited under the disguise of military exercises. By May, the Ukrainian government had <a href=""https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-defense/3254285-ukraine-tells-osce-about-number-of-Russian-troops-on-border-and-in-crimea.html"">estimated</a> that Russia had concentrated up to 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders and in the occupied Crimea.
Moscow, meanwhile, claimed it was responding to Kyiv’s provocations aimed at escalating the Donbas conflict. According to observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), there were no provocations.</p>
<p>Moreover, before Russia’s moving of troops to Ukraine’s borders in the spring of 2021, it were Russian-controlled militants, who had increased the number of shellings and heavy weapons which they, on the contrary, were to withdraw.</p>
<p>Thus, the number of ceasefire violations in early 2021 increased. But the vast majority of these violations were committed by militants, not Ukrainian troops. The <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/f/9/485372.pdf"">observations</a> of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine for January-March 2021 state: 98% of the total number of ceasefire violations were recorded in areas not controlled by the Ukrainian government. The mission recorded more than 500 weapons deployed in violation of agreed withdrawal lines. About 95% of them are in territories not under Ukraine’s control.</p>
Representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stressed since 2014 that they are not considering a forceful scenario for the return of the occupied Donbas. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine did not plan any offensive operations in Donbas. The only possible means declared were political and diplomatic.</p>
<p>shortly before Russia’s full-scale attack. on Ukraine, propaganda media reported that Volodymyr Zelensky had ordered to invade Donbas. In fact, Zelensky has never made such statements. Such a decree did not appear neither on the <a href=""https://www.president.gov.ua/documents/decrees?s-num=&contain-rule=contains&s-text=&date-from=01-01-2021&date-to=01-03-2022&order=asc&"">website</a> of the President of Ukraine nor in official publications, in which, according to Ukrainian law, this act had to be published.
The US State Department <a href=""https://www.state.gov/fact-vs-fiction-Russian-disinformation-on-ukraine/"">stressed</a> that Russian military and intelligence agencies are misinforming the world about the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attack on Donbas in order to portray Ukraine and Ukrainian officials as aggressors. In the same mold, Russia occupied part of Georgia in 2008 and did not withdraw its troops and ammunition from Moldova, where they still remain without government consent.</p>
<p>Data on the number of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are regularly published on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In <a href=""https://www.mil.gov.ua/content/mou_orders/mou_2021/372_nm.pdf"">December 2021</a>, there were more than 201,000 servicemen in the Armed Forces. Slightly more than 40,000 of them took part in the Joint Forces (JFO) operation in Donbas. So, clearly, not half of the army of Ukraine.
As for the Minsk agreements, it is Russia which has not yet ensured the implementation of security points. Nor has it implemented the  measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020.</p>"

<p> In February 2014, the same Verkhovna Rada that had operated under fugitive president Viktor Yanukovych (not the “West”) appointed the new government.</p> 
<p>After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power. Based on this, it appointed Oleksandr Turchynov President of Ukraine, on February 23. The then convocation of Verkhovna Rada <a href=""https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/247059910"">voted</a> for the new government and prime minister on February 27. Therefore, the Ukrainian government’s “illegitimacy” is a Russian propaganda myth.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian military in the East is at war with militants whom Russia supplies with Russian troops and weapons.</p>

When the then pro-Russian authorities announced the suspension of preparations for the country’s associate membership in the European Union, Ukrainians staged peaceful protests to maintain the pro-European orientation. After three months of protests, violent confrontations, and hundreds of casualties, early presidential elections were called followed by early parliamentary elections, in compliance with all constitutional requirements. In the same year, the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union was ratified.</p> 
<p>The coup d’etat is an unconstitutional seizure of power by a small group of individuals and conspirators acting in their own interests. The Revolution of Dignity began with peaceful protests by unarmed people supporting democratization. The authorities tried to suppress them by force, forcing them to use self-defense, and it was massive.

575,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Kyiv ignores fulfillment ot the Minsk Agreements,"The Ukrainian army began firing artillery almost every day on the territories of the LPR and DPR , despite the fact that large-caliber guns are banned under the Minsk agreements.",06/12/2021,Italy,Controinformazione,https://www.controinformazione.info/il-capo-della-dpr-visto-laccumulo-di-forze-nato-in-ucraina-dovremo-richiedere-assistenza-militare-alla-Russia-e-alla-bieloRussia/,"<p>The Minsk agreements were concluded as a result of the Ukrainian army defeats in 2014-2015, so they cannot be considered beneficial for Ukraine. Conditionally, the Minsk provisions can be divided into security and political parts.</p>  
<p>Security</p>  
<p>Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.
<p>Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers. In addition, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russia has not implemented an all-for-all exchange, has not provided humanitarian aid through international mechanisms, has not allowed socio-economic ties to be restored and has not fulfilled a bunch of other points.</p> 
<p>Political part</p> 
<p>First, the agreements themselves do not clearly specify the procedure for implementing the provisions. Therefore, Russia cannot claim that Ukraine must first fulfill the political part – to adopt a special status for Donbas and hold local elections.</p> 
<p> Secondly, Russia claims that Ukraine should give Donbas autonomy. Whereas in Minsk it is only a matter of “special status” – not autonomy.</p> 
<p>The special status for Donbas will give the region significant privileges and make the rest of the regions be in an unequal position. Ukraine must also agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections. These elections must be held under Ukrainian law, which is impossible due to the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, Russia has issued its passports to more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, most of whom left ORDLO, is 1.4 million. And most of them will not be able to vote in the election. As a result, Russia has significantly changed the situation in the ORDLO and stepped up its intervention.</p> "

<p>In March 2014, there were rallies in Donetsk and Luhansk: in favor of joining Russia and uniting with Ukraine. Local witnesses said people had been brought from the Russian border to participate in pro-Russian rallies.</p> 
<p>In April, armed men (local and Russian citizens) began to capture city authorities in the Donbas region. According to a Radio Liberty <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/31380909.html"">investigation</a>, Russian army officers led the operations. The separatists proclaimed the so-called “DPR” on April 7, 2014, and the “LPR” on April 27, 2014.</p>  
<p>According to a Bellingcat <a href=""https://ru.bellingcat.com/novosti/ukraine/2016/12/21/putins-undeclared-war-summer-2014-Russian-artillery-strikes-against-ukraine/"">investigation</a>, military units liquidated all Ukrainian authorities in the occupied territories in April and May and began shelling Ukrainian cities with heavy artillery. They opened fire from the occupied territories of Ukraine and Russia.</p>  
<p> However, they failed to stop the Armed Forces’ offensive. The Kremlin sent 4,000 regular army soldiers to Donbas in August 2014, an Atlantic Council <a href=""https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/191186/HPS_RW_Russian_0713_final_web.pdf"">report</a> said. Using satellite images, Bellingcat <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/80e03612c0fdf764d9422be26cdf4b97/Russias-path-s-to-war/index.html"">established</a> that Russian troops had crossed the border. The Russian military took an active part in the fighting, and their intervention turned the tide of the battle.</p>  
<p>According to Ukrainian intelligence reports, at least <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/amp/donbas-realii/29721302.html?fbclid=IwAR0DxGV2Tt6r_TGZz2VihZAiNdc7cdwrw6QWrODSBpo4VX6Kp2AKZKJl0ro"">11 Russian generals</a> commanded the “troops” made up of the DNR and LNR groups.</p> 
<p> In February 2014, the same Verkhovna Rada that had operated under fugitive president Viktor Yanukovych (not the “West”) appointed the new government.</p> 
<p>After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power. Based on this, it appointed Oleksandr Turchynov President of Ukraine, on February 23. The then convocation of Verkhovna Rada <a href=""https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/247059910"">voted</a> for the new government and prime minister on February 27. Therefore, the Ukrainian government’s “illegitimacy” is a Russian propaganda myth.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian military in the East is at war with militants whom Russia supplies with Russian troops and weapons.</p> 
<p>Evidence of Russian troops and military equipment in Donbas is plentiful. We will provide it in this <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/rosiya-ne-ye-agresorom-shhodo-ukrayiny-oglyad-italijskyh-ta-nimetskyh-prorosijskyh-zmi/#_ftn1"">article</a>.</p> "

At the same time, it is commented just in the Russian narrative.</p>
<p>According to the definition in the law, indigenous people are “autochthonous ethnic community formed on the territory of Ukraine, bearer of original language and culture, having traditional, social, cultural or representative bodies, have the self-awareness of the indigenous people of Ukraine, constitute the ethnic minority in its population and does not have its own state entity outside Ukraine”. Among the indigenous peoples are those peoples who were formed on the territory of Crimea – the Crimean Tatars, Karaites, and so on.</p>
<p>Russians cannot be the indigenous people of Ukraine: they have their own state formation outside our country. However, this does not mean that they will be deprived of basic rights in the state.</p>"
525,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Ukraine builds up military forces in Donbas,"What the Western media has carefully ignored is the actual concentration of Ukrainian troops on the borders of the Donbas, the temporarily Ukrainian industrialized region, which has been de facto independent since 2014, the year of the Kyiv putsch.",28/11/2021,Italy,Come Don Chisciotte,https://comedonchisciotte.org/chi-vuole-un-po-di-ucraina/,"<p>Russia was the first to mobilize  its troops to Ukraine’s borders – without any threat from Ukraine</p>  
<p>In December 2021, Russian politicians, including President Putin and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, claimed that Ukraine had moved half of its army (or 120,000 to 125,000 troops) to the war zone. They did not release any confirmation of the mentioned data.</p>
<p>Data on the number of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are regularly published on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The information is also available in the passports of budget programs exposed for public access. In December 2021, there were more than 201,000 servicemen in the Armed Forces. Just over 40,000 of them took part in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). That is three times less than what was said in Russia. For comparison, in February 2021, just over 40,000 servicemen took part in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). Almost a year before, in May 2020 there had been the same number – 40 thousand.</p>
<p>The number of Ukrainian servicemen in Donbas did not increase. Instead, in October-November 2021, Russia, according to various estimates, drew about 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s borders.
There is no evidence, in particular from independent observers, that Kyiv was going to attack Donbas</p>
<p>In the autumn of 2021, Russia once again declared that Ukraine was preparing for the “offensive in Donbas.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation announced offensive actions of the Armed Forces in the area of ​​Granitny and Staromaryivka (Donetsk region), referring to the reports of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.
This is not true: the Mission’s daily reports did not mention this. Instead, OSCE SMM reports during this period revealed the systemic restrictions on freedom of movement in the temporarily occupied territories (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505267"">for example, here</a>), blocking of communications and surveillance (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505276"">here</a>), threats to the personal security of international observers by Russian armed forces (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/512884"">here</a>)</p>
<p>The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not open fire first and do not shell civilians and infrastructure in Donbas</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Armed Forces first used the Turkish Bayraktar drone in October 2021. The parties have banned the use of UAVs in the context of a truce signed in July 2020 within the Tripartite Contact Group. The first paragraph states a “ban on the use of any type of aircraft.” But there is also a ban on any “use of fire, including sniper fire” – and this point is constantly being neglected by the Russian occupation forces.</p>
<p>Bayraktar was used as a last resort. The militants fired from 122-mm howitzers prohibited by the Minsk agreements on civilian targets and positions of the Armed Forces near Granitny in the Donetsk region for several days. In addition, Russian mercenaries dropped explosive devices with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle.</p>
<p>The militants did not stop the shelling even after the Ukrainian side used a standard response mechanism: the OSCE SMM called for a ceasefire. And under the terms of the July 2020 truce, retaliatory fire is allowed in the event of a failed response.
Ukraine did not violate the Minsk agreements: Bayraktar did not cross the contact line, the howitzer was destroyed by a guided missile.</p>
<p>In addition, the first drones in Donbas were, in fact, used by militants: Russian UAVs “Orlan-10” <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sergiy.garmash/posts/3854732251293562"">have long been recorded</a> in Donbas.</p>
<p>The West did not “pump Ukraine with weapons”, but provided weapons to repel a possible Russian attack</p>
<p>The bulk of the weapons received by Ukraine are anti-tank systems (NLAW, Javelin), which make little sense in the event of the attack of the Armed Forces on uncontrolled territories, but are necessary in the event of an attack by armored vehicles from the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Russia has been supporting separatists in Donbas since 2014, supplying them with modern weapons, heavy weapons, troops and training. This has been repeatedly <a href=""https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_117496.htm?selectedLocale=uk"">confirmed</a> by NATO, Ukrainian and American <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/25463277.html"">intelligence</a></p>"

<p>Second, there is no evidence from independent observers (including the OSCE SMM, which worked directly in the region) that Kyiv has resorted to terrorist attacks or sabotage in the Donbas. As well as the fact that other countries, including the United States, may have been involved.</p> 
<p>With “chemical attacks” Russia has intimidated the population of Donbas for years, at least since 2018. In 2021, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was the first to report on “chemical weapons in the Donbas.” Later, the leader of the so-called “DPR” Denis Pushylin picked up this information flow. The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine called it disinformation, and the US State Department also <a href=""https://twitter.com/StateDeptSpox/status/1473444488337293313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1473444488337293313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radiosvoboda.org%2Fa%2Fnews-pentagon-shoygu%2F31620567.html"">denied</a> it.</p>

<p>There is no reason to claim that Ukraine was preparing to attack Donbas
Since 2014 the representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stressed that they are not considering a forceful scenario to return the occupied Donbas. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine did not  plan any offensive operations in Donbas. Whereas the only acceptable means to do so would be political and diplomatic.
The detailed report on the reasons why Russia arranged the escalation in Donbas before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine can be found here.</p> "
456,Russia is not an agressor towards Ukraine,"Conflict in Eastern Ukraine is solely internal, i.e, a civil war","Following that coup and the Donbas's refusal (along with Crimea) to recognize the new Ukrainian government installed by the US State Department, the Ukrainians had attempted to retake the Donbas by force.

<p>In March 2014, there were rallies in Donetsk and Luhansk: in favor of joining Russia and uniting with Ukraine. Local witnesses said people had been brought from the Russian border to participate in pro-Russian rallies.</p> 
<p>In April, armed men (local and Russian citizens) began to capture city authorities in the Donbas region. According to a Radio Liberty <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/31380909.html"">investigation</a>, Russian army officers led the operations. The separatists proclaimed the so-called “DPR” on April 7, 2014, and the “LPR” on April 27, 2014.</p>

They opened fire from the occupied territories of Ukraine and Russia.</p>  
<p> However, they failed to stop the Armed Forces’ offensive. The Kremlin sent 4,000 regular army soldiers to Donbas in August 2014, an Atlantic Council <a href=""https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/191186/HPS_RW_Russian_0713_final_web.pdf"">report</a> said.

<p> In February 2014, the same Verkhovna Rada that had operated under fugitive president Viktor Yanukovych (not the “West”) appointed the new government.</p> 
<p>After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power. Based on this, it appointed Oleksandr Turchynov President of Ukraine, on February 23.

Therefore, the Ukrainian government’s “illegitimacy” is a Russian propaganda myth.</p>

<p>In March 2014, there were rallies in Donetsk and Luhansk: in favor of joining Russia and uniting with Ukraine. Local witnesses said people had been brought from the Russian border to participate in pro-Russian rallies.</p> 
<p>In April, armed men (local and Russian citizens) began to capture city authorities in the Donbas region. According to a Radio Liberty <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/31380909.html"">investigation</a>, Russian army officers led the operations.

<p>After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power.

By then, the military without insignia had already seized the parliament building. Journalists were not allowed into the hall. Whether there was a quorum for making this decision and how the MPs voted under the barrels of guns is unknown. </p>
<p>In 2015, Igor Strelkov (Girkin), a leader in the operation of taking over Crimea, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICgazA79a2g&ab_channel=HalahanValerii"">admitted</a> that the deputies had to be “herded” into the Parliament to vote on February 27.</p>
<p>Two questions were <a href=""http://crimea.gov.ru/act/11689"">put up</a> for the referendum: “Do you support the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation?” and “Do you support the restoration of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea as of 1992 and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?” None of them provided for the possibility of maintaining the status quo. </p>
<p> <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/krym/show/rb076a002-92"">Crimea’s Constitution as of 1992</a> provided broad autonomy rights for the peninsula. As if it were a separate state having its governing bodies and “exercising in its territory all of its powers except those voluntarily delegated to Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The “referendum” was also illegitimate from the point of view of Ukrainian laws. According to Article 73 of Ukraine’s Constitution, the issue of changing the territory is decided only at an all-Ukrainian referendum. Whether Crimea should be part of Ukraine had to be agreed upon by all the regions, and the voting of people in Crimea alone was not enough for such a decision.</p>
<p>In truth, the Crimean “referendum” took place without international observers who could document violations. However, Crimean journalists and voters have repeatedly <a href=""https://crimea.suspilne.media/ua/articles/45""> stated</a>  that ballots were distributed in a massive way to the same people. They were also given to people with Russian passports.</p>

<p>Neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor the United States recognized the results of Crimea’s “referendum.” On March 27, 2021, <a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464812-backing-ukraines-territorial-integrity-un-assembly-declares-crimea-referendum"">passed</a> a resolution to support Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power. Based on this, it appointed Oleksandr Turchynov President of Ukraine, on February 23. The then convocation of Verkhovna Rada <a href=""https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/247059910"">voted</a> for the new government and prime minister on February 27. Therefore, the Ukrainian government’s “illegitimacy” is a Russian propaganda myth.</p>

553,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Ukraine denounced Minsk Agreements,"Ukraine revealed, on Friday 3 September, that it had ""disengaged"" from the Minsk Agreements that linked it to Russia for the resolution of the crisis in Donbas. The Kyiv authorities have described the achievement as ""revolutionary"".",03/09/2021,Italy,Sicurezza Internazionale,https://sicurezzainternazionale.luiss.it/2021/09/03/Russia-ucraina-kiev-si-svincola-dagli-accordi-minsk-sul-donbass/,"<p>Neither the Ukrainian government nor the parliament has ever announced its withdrawal from the Minsk agreements</p>  
<p>Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has consistently emphasized that Ukraine is not renouncing the Minsk agreements. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has never said that the Minsk agreements are invalid. Moreover, in December 2021, he announced that Ukraine had developed a 10-step plan for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements and passed it on to the United States, Germany, France and Russia.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2268-19#Text"">law</a> on the reintegration of Donbas, adopted in 2018, does not mention the Minsk agreements at all, especially the refusal to comply with them.</p> 
<p>It (the Law “On the peculiarities of state policy to ensure the state sovereignty of Ukraine in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions”) states that Ukraine was attacked by Russia, which is the aggressor and occupier, and the part of the Donbas is occupied by it. And the illegal armed groups “LPR” and “DPR”, which actually control the occupied territories, are “representatives of the occupation administrations of Russia.” The law does not contradict the provisions of the Minsk agreements. But, of course, Russia cannot like it, hiding its participation in the war in Donbas.</p> 
<p>Ukraine did not report withdrawing from the Minsk agreements shortly before Russia’s full-scale attack.</p> 
<p>Propaganda resources misrepresented the content of the quote from Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the head of the President’s Office. After the meeting of Volodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden in September 2021, Arestovych told one of the Ukrainian TV channels that the parties had agreed on the possibility of modernizing the Minsk agreements. And he addressed the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Lavrov with the words: “Mr. Lavrov, my best regards to you: we are off the hook of the Minsk agreements.” Shortly before that, Lavrov said that “Russia will not allow Zelensky and Ukraine to” get off the hook of the Minsk agreements“.</p> 
<p>Later, Oleksiy Arestovych said that “the Minsk agreements haven’t vanished”, the parties did not announce their withdrawal. He spoke only about the interpretation of the agreements required by Russia: “Well, the news for Lavrov is that the hook of the Minsk agreements no longer exists. Nor the Minsk agreements, namely the hook of the Minsk agreements, that is, the Russian version of their interpretation, which they tried to impose on us and the world community“.</p> 
<p>In fact it is Russia, which does not fulfill most of the statements of the Minsk agreements
This was the reason for  the EU <a href=""https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/01/13/Russia-eu-renews-economic-sanctions-over-the-situation-in-ukraine-for-further-six-months/"">extending</a> sanctions against Russia in January 2022.
Russia blocks OSCE observers from accessing certain areas and does not provide humanitarian aid through international mechanisms.

<p> At the same time, Russia claims that it is not a party in the Minsk agreements and is not mentioned in the text. But these documents were signed by Russia’s representative Mikhail Zubarov.</p> 
<p>Russia is trying to force Ukraine to implement “Minsk” on its own terms. First, Ukraine must adopt a special status for Donbas, which will give the region significant privileges and put the rest of Ukraine’s regions in an unequal position. Second, Ukraine must agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections are held there. But these elections must be held in compliance with Ukrainian law, which is impossible under the conditions of the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories have received Russian passports. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, mostly from ORDLO, is 1.4 million, and most of them will not be able to take part in the elections.</p> "

When, finally, all of Ukraine became US property in 2014, the White House quickly realized, to their horror, that several US administrations had invested significant amounts of money in a completely useless product.

376,Russia is not an agressor towards Ukraine,Russia did not occupy Crimea. It was a reunification," In early 2014, after the Maidan coup in Kiev, Crimean residents decided to join the Russian Federation. Despite the tense situation in Ukraine at the time, this was confirmed by a referendum in which Western politicians also participated as observers.",09/07/2021,Italy,Controinformazione,https://www.controinformazione.info/lesperto-tedesco-patrick-poppel-la-crimea-e-un-pericoloso-gioco-della-nato/,"<p>The decision to hold a so-called “referendum” was made at a session of the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea on February 27, 2014. By then, the military without insignia had already seized the parliament building. Journalists were not allowed into the hall. Whether there was a quorum for making this decision and how the MPs voted under the barrels of guns is unknown. </p>
<p>In 2015, Igor Strelkov (Girkin), a leader in the operation of taking over Crimea, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICgazA79a2g&ab_channel=HalahanValerii"">admitted</a> that the deputies had to be “herded” into the Parliament to vote on February 27.</p>
<p>Two questions were <a href=""http://crimea.gov.ru/act/11689"">put up</a> for the referendum: “Do you support the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation?” and “Do you support the restoration of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea as of 1992 and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?” None of them provided for the possibility of maintaining the status quo. </p>
<p> <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/krym/show/rb076a002-92"">Crimea’s Constitution as of 1992</a> provided broad autonomy rights for the peninsula. As if it were a separate state having its governing bodies and “exercising in its territory all of its powers except those voluntarily delegated to Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The “referendum” was also illegitimate from the point of view of Ukrainian laws. According to Article 73 of Ukraine’s Constitution, the issue of changing the territory is decided only at an all-Ukrainian referendum. Whether Crimea should be part of Ukraine had to be agreed upon by all the regions, and the voting of people in Crimea alone was not enough for such a decision.</p>
<p>In truth, the Crimean “referendum” took place without international observers who could document violations. However, Crimean journalists and voters have repeatedly <a href=""https://crimea.suspilne.media/ua/articles/45""> stated</a>  that ballots were distributed in a massive way to the same people. They were also given to people with Russian passports.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Venice Commission unanimously adopted an  <a href=""https://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2014)002-e"">opinion</a> viewing the referendum in Crimea as unlawful and violating, besides the Constitution of Ukraine, basic international principles regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty of subjects of international law.</p>

3. More than 100 years later, the 1897 census of the Russian Empire showed that the so-called “Little Russian” (i.e., Ukrainian) language dominates not only in modern Ukraine (particularly in the “historically Russian” lands mentioned by Putin) but also goes beyond it.
4. The “similarity” of languages ​​and religions was created artificially by Russia: in 1720, Peter I ordered the publication of books only in Russian, and in 1863 Peter Valuev almost completely banned all printing in Ukrainian; Ukrainians tried to establish their own church as early as 1302, as evidenced by the existence of the Galician Metropolis, abolished by the pressure of Moscow’s Tsar Simeon the Proud in 1347.</p>"

No matter how much Russia justified its actions, in 2014 it was it that started the war in eastern Ukraine and occupied Crimea. It was Russia that systematically violated the Minsk agreements during the 8 years of the hybrid war.</p>

All members of the Alliance confirmed at the Brussels Summit in June 2021 that “the Alliance does not seek confrontation and does not pose a threat to Russia.”</p>
<p>In January 2022, amid Russia’s disinformation about the border situation, the US Secretary of State’s Office <a href=""https://www.state.gov/fact-vs-fiction-Russian-disinformation-on-ukraine/"">issued</a> a disproof, including on NATO’s plans. NATO did not surround Russia and did not plan to deploy Allied forces in the eastern part of the Alliance until Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea. Multinational battle groups in the Baltic states and Poland were deployed in 2016 in response to Russia’s use of military force against its neighbors. These forces are rotational, defensive and proportional. NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. Each sovereign state has the right to choose its own security mechanisms and to join regional defense alliances for self-defense. This is a fundamental principle of European security, reflected in the UN Charter, and one that Russia has reaffirmed in many international and regional instruments, such as the Helsinki Final Act.</p> "

<p>Second, there is no evidence from independent observers (including the OSCE SMM, which worked directly in the region) that Kyiv has resorted to terrorist attacks or sabotage in the Donbas. As well as the fact that other countries, including the United States, may have been involved.</p> 
<p>With “chemical attacks” Russia has intimidated the population of Donbas for years, at least since 2018. In 2021, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was the first to report on “chemical weapons in the Donbas.” Later, the leader of the so-called “DPR” Denis Pushylin picked up this information flow. The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine called it disinformation, and the US State Department also <a href=""https://twitter.com/StateDeptSpox/status/1473444488337293313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1473444488337293313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.radiosvoboda.org%2Fa%2Fnews-pentagon-shoygu%2F31620567.html"">denied</a> it.</p> 
<p>They also <a href=""https://www.state.gov/fact-vs-fiction-Russian-disinformation-on-ukraine/"">recalled</a> that in recent years, the Russian government has used chemical weapons twice to attack as well as attempt to kill its opponents, particularly on foreign territory.</p> 
<p>There is no reason to claim that Ukraine was preparing to attack Donbas
Since 2014 the representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stressed that they are not considering a forceful scenario to return the occupied Donbas. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine did not  plan any offensive operations in Donbas. Whereas the only acceptable means to do so would be political and diplomatic.
The detailed report on the reasons why Russia arranged the escalation in Donbas before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine can be found here.</p> "

No matter how much Russia justified its actions, in 2014 it was it that started the war in eastern Ukraine and occupied Crimea. It was Russia that systematically violated the Minsk agreements during the 8 years of the hybrid war.</p> 
<p>NATO, in turn, has repeatedly <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-nato-ukraina/31678391.html"">stated</a> that it will not send troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian attack. All members of the Alliance confirmed at the Brussels Summit in June 2021 that “the Alliance does not seek confrontation and does not pose a threat to Russia.”</p>
<p>In January 2022, amid Russia’s disinformation about the border situation, the US Secretary of State’s Office <a href=""https://www.state.gov/fact-vs-fiction-Russian-disinformation-on-ukraine/"">issued</a> a disproof, including on NATO’s plans. NATO did not surround Russia and did not plan to deploy Allied forces in the eastern part of the Alliance until Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea. Multinational battle groups in the Baltic states and Poland were deployed in 2016 in response to Russia’s use of military force against its neighbors. These forces are rotational, defensive and proportional. NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. Each sovereign state has the right to choose its own security mechanisms and to join regional defense alliances for self-defense. This is a fundamental principle of European security, reflected in the UN Charter, and one that Russia has reaffirmed in many international and regional instruments, such as the Helsinki Final Act.</p> "

Conditionally, the Minsk provisions can be divided into security and political parts.</p>  
<p>Security</p>  
<p>Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.
<p>Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers. In addition, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russia has not implemented an all-for-all exchange, has not provided humanitarian aid through international mechanisms, has not allowed socio-economic ties to be restored and has not fulfilled a bunch of other points.</p> 
<p>Political part</p> 
<p>First, the agreements themselves do not clearly specify the procedure for implementing the provisions. Therefore, Russia cannot claim that Ukraine must first fulfill the political part – to adopt a special status for Donbas and hold local elections.</p> 
<p> Secondly, Russia claims that Ukraine should give Donbas autonomy. Whereas in Minsk it is only a matter of “special status” – not autonomy.</p> 
<p>The special status for Donbas will give the region significant privileges and make the rest of the regions be in an unequal position. Ukraine must also agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections. These elections must be held under Ukrainian law, which is impossible due to the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, Russia has issued its passports to more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, most of whom left ORDLO, is 1.4 million. And most of them will not be able to vote in the election. As a result, Russia has significantly changed the situation in the ORDLO and stepped up its intervention.</p> "
558,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Ukraine denounced Minsk Agreements,Ukraine declares Minsk agreements non-binding and biased in favor of Donbass,17/06/2020,Italy,Controinformazione,https://www.controinformazione.info/lucraina-dichiara-laccordo-di-minsk-non-vincolante-e-sbilanciato-a-favore-del-donbass/,"<p>Neither the Ukrainian government nor the parliament has ever announced its withdrawal from the Minsk agreements</p>  
<p>Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has consistently emphasized that Ukraine is not renouncing the Minsk agreements. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has never said that the Minsk agreements are invalid. Moreover, in December 2021, he announced that Ukraine had developed a 10-step plan for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements and passed it on to the United States, Germany, France and Russia.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2268-19#Text"">law</a> on the reintegration of Donbas, adopted in 2018, does not mention the Minsk agreements at all, especially the refusal to comply with them.</p> 
<p>It (the Law “On the peculiarities of state policy to ensure the state sovereignty of Ukraine in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions”) states that Ukraine was attacked by Russia, which is the aggressor and occupier, and the part of the Donbas is occupied by it. And the illegal armed groups “LPR” and “DPR”, which actually control the occupied territories, are “representatives of the occupation administrations of Russia.” The law does not contradict the provisions of the Minsk agreements. But, of course, Russia cannot like it, hiding its participation in the war in Donbas.</p> 
<p>Ukraine did not report withdrawing from the Minsk agreements shortly before Russia’s full-scale attack.</p> 
<p>Propaganda resources misrepresented the content of the quote from Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the head of the President’s Office. After the meeting of Volodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden in September 2021, Arestovych told one of the Ukrainian TV channels that the parties had agreed on the possibility of modernizing the Minsk agreements. And he addressed the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Lavrov with the words: “Mr. Lavrov, my best regards to you: we are off the hook of the Minsk agreements.” Shortly before that, Lavrov said that “Russia will not allow Zelensky and Ukraine to” get off the hook of the Minsk agreements“.</p> 
<p>Later, Oleksiy Arestovych said that “the Minsk agreements haven’t vanished”, the parties did not announce their withdrawal. He spoke only about the interpretation of the agreements required by Russia: “Well, the news for Lavrov is that the hook of the Minsk agreements no longer exists. Nor the Minsk agreements, namely the hook of the Minsk agreements, that is, the Russian version of their interpretation, which they tried to impose on us and the world community“.</p> 
<p>In fact it is Russia, which does not fulfill most of the statements of the Minsk agreements
This was the reason for  the EU <a href=""https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/01/13/Russia-eu-renews-economic-sanctions-over-the-situation-in-ukraine-for-further-six-months/"">extending</a> sanctions against Russia in January 2022.
Russia blocks OSCE observers from accessing certain areas and does not provide humanitarian aid through international mechanisms. Russia does not comply with the security provisions of the Minsk agreements: a ceasefire, complete withdrawal of pro-Russian militants and Russian weapons from Ukraine.</p> 
<p> At the same time, Russia claims that it is not a party in the Minsk agreements and is not mentioned in the text. But these documents were signed by Russia’s representative Mikhail Zubarov.</p> 
<p>Russia is trying to force Ukraine to implement “Minsk” on its own terms. First, Ukraine must adopt a special status for Donbas, which will give the region significant privileges and put the rest of Ukraine’s regions in an unequal position. Second, Ukraine must agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections are held there. But these elections must be held in compliance with Ukrainian law, which is impossible under the conditions of the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories have received Russian passports. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, mostly from ORDLO, is 1.4 million, and most of them will not be able to take part in the elections.</p> "

Numerous pieces of evidence <a href=""https://suspilne.media/147713-ricnica-tragedii-mn17-hronika-rozsliduvanna-ta-ucast-ukraini/"">confirm this fact</a>:
About two hours after the crash, one of the militant leaders, Igor Girkin (Strelkov), the “DPR’s” defense minister, published a report that the “DPR” had shot down a Ukrainian AN-26 aircraft near Torez. However, when it became known that it was not a Ukrainian military plane that was shot down, but a passenger plane, Girkin deleted his post.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) <a href=""https://youtu.be/V5E8kDo2n6g"">intercepted</a> conversations of militants on the day of the catastrophe, where terrorists are probably discussing the downing of the Boeing MH17. A version of the downing of the plane from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system was formed on the basis of these conversations.
Independent Bellingcat investigators found that Buk anti-aircraft missile system was transported to the “DPR” from Russia. They confirmed this information with intercepted conversations, satellite photos and social media posts. The Buk which shot down the plane <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/"">belonged</a> to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Army from Kursk.</p> 
<p>The information that the Boeing MH17 was shot down by “DPR” terrorists from the Buk transported from Russia is confirmed by <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN11Y0WN"">the data </a>  of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), led by the Netherlands.</p> 
<p>JIT investigators <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G"">have named</a> four people involved in the downing of a Malaysian Boeing in June 2019. According to the investigation, Igor Girkin, a former “DPR” defense minister, Oleg Pulatov, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian Airborne Forces, Sergey Dubinsky, a retired GRU officer, Leonid Kharchenko, a commander of the intelligence unit at “GRU DPR”, a Ukrainian. The first three suspects at the time of the JIT statement were in Russia, and Kharchenko was in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine. All four are suspect of organizing the supply of anti-aircraft missile system.</p> 
<p>Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shooting down a Boeing and tried to provide its “evidence”. However, all this is a lie. For example, in 2015, Bellingcat journalists used digital satellite images from Globe to <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/06/12/july-17-imagery-mod-comparison/?fbclid=IwAR1MN5oc-0uiQu9NzwkY6HfI1N3VuslUjIKy1YkZWpHSVQcuIkfHxFO4oBM"">expose</a> Russia’s lies about the Malaysian Boeing MH17. Investigators have found that the Russian Defense Ministry published fake photos from space on the day of the catastrophe.</p> 
<p>The Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that MH17 was shot down by a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. It is not true.</p> 
<p>First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17. Experiments confirm that the Su-25 can rise to an altitude of 10,000 km, but without weapons.</p> 
<p>Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17. This was <a href=""https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/krieg-in-der-ukraine-mh-17-wurde-vom-boden-aus-abgeschossen-1.2386385"">stated</a> by one of the designers of the Su-25 Vladimir Babak and the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">editor of the military magazine</a> HS Jane’s Defense Weekly Nick de Larrinaga.</p> 
<p>Third, around 800 pieces of shrapnel <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">had ripped</a> through MH17. This confirms that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, not an air-to-air missile with much less power. Thus, it is impossible to shot down the plane from the Su-25, how Russia stated.</p> 
<p>Russia has called the investigation biased and partial, but has refused to cooperate with other countries. In 2020, Russia <a href=""https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/4387013"">withdrew</a> from consultations with the Netherlands and Australia on the MH17 disaster.</p> "

<p>Two questions were <a href=""http://crimea.gov.ru/act/11689"">put up</a> for the referendum: “Do you support the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation?” and “Do you support the restoration of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea as of 1992 and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?” None of them provided for the possibility of maintaining the status quo. </p>
<p> <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/krym/show/rb076a002-92"">Crimea’s Constitution as of 1992</a> provided broad autonomy rights for the peninsula. As if it were a separate state having its governing bodies and “exercising in its territory all of its powers except those voluntarily delegated to Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The “referendum” was also illegitimate from the point of view of Ukrainian laws. According to Article 73 of Ukraine’s Constitution, the issue of changing the territory is decided only at an all-Ukrainian referendum. Whether Crimea should be part of Ukraine had to be agreed upon by all the regions, and the voting of people in Crimea alone was not enough for such a decision.</p>
<p>In truth, the Crimean “referendum” took place without international observers who could document violations. However, Crimean journalists and voters have repeatedly <a href=""https://crimea.suspilne.media/ua/articles/45""> stated</a>  that ballots were distributed in a massive way to the same people. They were also given to people with Russian passports.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Venice Commission unanimously adopted an  <a href=""https://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2014)002-e"">opinion</a> viewing the referendum in Crimea as unlawful and violating, besides the Constitution of Ukraine, basic international principles regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty of subjects of international law.</p>
<p>Neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor the United States recognized the results of Crimea’s “referendum.” On March 27, 2021, <a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464812-backing-ukraines-territorial-integrity-un-assembly-declares-crimea-referendum"">passed</a> a resolution to support Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

559,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Ukraine denounced Minsk Agreements,Ukrainian president Zelensky ready to leave the Minsk agreements,11/03/2020,Italy,Controinformazione,https://www.controinformazione.info/il-presidente-ucraino-zelensky-pronto-a-lasciare-gli-accordi-di-minsk-la-risposta-del-ministro-degli-esteri-della-dnr-nikonorova/,"<p>Neither the Ukrainian government nor the parliament has ever announced its withdrawal from the Minsk agreements</p>  
<p>Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has consistently emphasized that Ukraine is not renouncing the Minsk agreements. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has never said that the Minsk agreements are invalid. Moreover, in December 2021, he announced that Ukraine had developed a 10-step plan for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements and passed it on to the United States, Germany, France and Russia.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2268-19#Text"">law</a> on the reintegration of Donbas, adopted in 2018, does not mention the Minsk agreements at all, especially the refusal to comply with them.</p> 
<p>It (the Law “On the peculiarities of state policy to ensure the state sovereignty of Ukraine in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions”) states that Ukraine was attacked by Russia, which is the aggressor and occupier, and the part of the Donbas is occupied by it. And the illegal armed groups “LPR” and “DPR”, which actually control the occupied territories, are “representatives of the occupation administrations of Russia.” The law does not contradict the provisions of the Minsk agreements. But, of course, Russia cannot like it, hiding its participation in the war in Donbas.</p> 
<p>Ukraine did not report withdrawing from the Minsk agreements shortly before Russia’s full-scale attack.</p> 
<p>Propaganda resources misrepresented the content of the quote from Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the head of the President’s Office. After the meeting of Volodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden in September 2021, Arestovych told one of the Ukrainian TV channels that the parties had agreed on the possibility of modernizing the Minsk agreements. And he addressed the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Lavrov with the words: “Mr. Lavrov, my best regards to you: we are off the hook of the Minsk agreements.” Shortly before that, Lavrov said that “Russia will not allow Zelensky and Ukraine to” get off the hook of the Minsk agreements“.</p> 
<p>Later, Oleksiy Arestovych said that “the Minsk agreements haven’t vanished”, the parties did not announce their withdrawal. He spoke only about the interpretation of the agreements required by Russia: “Well, the news for Lavrov is that the hook of the Minsk agreements no longer exists. Nor the Minsk agreements, namely the hook of the Minsk agreements, that is, the Russian version of their interpretation, which they tried to impose on us and the world community“.</p> 
<p>In fact it is Russia, which does not fulfill most of the statements of the Minsk agreements
This was the reason for  the EU <a href=""https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/01/13/Russia-eu-renews-economic-sanctions-over-the-situation-in-ukraine-for-further-six-months/"">extending</a> sanctions against Russia in January 2022.
Russia blocks OSCE observers from accessing certain areas and does not provide humanitarian aid through international mechanisms. Russia does not comply with the security provisions of the Minsk agreements: a ceasefire, complete withdrawal of pro-Russian militants and Russian weapons from Ukraine.</p> 
<p> At the same time, Russia claims that it is not a party in the Minsk agreements and is not mentioned in the text. But these documents were signed by Russia’s representative Mikhail Zubarov.</p> 
<p>Russia is trying to force Ukraine to implement “Minsk” on its own terms. First, Ukraine must adopt a special status for Donbas, which will give the region significant privileges and put the rest of Ukraine’s regions in an unequal position. Second, Ukraine must agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections are held there. But these elections must be held in compliance with Ukrainian law, which is impossible under the conditions of the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories have received Russian passports. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, mostly from ORDLO, is 1.4 million, and most of them will not be able to take part in the elections.</p> "

Numerous pieces of evidence <a href=""https://suspilne.media/147713-ricnica-tragedii-mn17-hronika-rozsliduvanna-ta-ucast-ukraini/"">confirm this fact</a>:
About two hours after the crash, one of the militant leaders, Igor Girkin (Strelkov), the “DPR’s” defense minister, published a report that the “DPR” had shot down a Ukrainian AN-26 aircraft near Torez. However, when it became known that it was not a Ukrainian military plane that was shot down, but a passenger plane, Girkin deleted his post.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) <a href=""https://youtu.be/V5E8kDo2n6g"">intercepted</a> conversations of militants on the day of the catastrophe, where terrorists are probably discussing the downing of the Boeing MH17. A version of the downing of the plane from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system was formed on the basis of these conversations.
Independent Bellingcat investigators found that Buk anti-aircraft missile system was transported to the “DPR” from Russia. They confirmed this information with intercepted conversations, satellite photos and social media posts. The Buk which shot down the plane <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/"">belonged</a> to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Army from Kursk.</p> 
<p>The information that the Boeing MH17 was shot down by “DPR” terrorists from the Buk transported from Russia is confirmed by <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN11Y0WN"">the data </a>  of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), led by the Netherlands.</p> 
<p>JIT investigators <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G"">have named</a> four people involved in the downing of a Malaysian Boeing in June 2019. According to the investigation, Igor Girkin, a former “DPR” defense minister, Oleg Pulatov, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian Airborne Forces, Sergey Dubinsky, a retired GRU officer, Leonid Kharchenko, a commander of the intelligence unit at “GRU DPR”, a Ukrainian. The first three suspects at the time of the JIT statement were in Russia, and Kharchenko was in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine. All four are suspect of organizing the supply of anti-aircraft missile system.</p> 
<p>Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shooting down a Boeing and tried to provide its “evidence”. However, all this is a lie. For example, in 2015, Bellingcat journalists used digital satellite images from Globe to <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/06/12/july-17-imagery-mod-comparison/?fbclid=IwAR1MN5oc-0uiQu9NzwkY6HfI1N3VuslUjIKy1YkZWpHSVQcuIkfHxFO4oBM"">expose</a> Russia’s lies about the Malaysian Boeing MH17. Investigators have found that the Russian Defense Ministry published fake photos from space on the day of the catastrophe.</p> 
<p>The Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that MH17 was shot down by a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. It is not true.</p> 
<p>First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17.

<p>Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17. This was <a href=""https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/krieg-in-der-ukraine-mh-17-wurde-vom-boden-aus-abgeschossen-1.2386385"">stated</a> by one of the designers of the Su-25 Vladimir Babak and the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">editor of the military magazine</a> HS Jane’s Defense Weekly Nick de Larrinaga.</p> 
<p>Third, around 800 pieces of shrapnel <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">had ripped</a> through MH17. This confirms that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, not an air-to-air missile with much less power. Thus, it is impossible to shot down the plane from the Su-25, how Russia stated.</p> 
<p>Russia has called the investigation biased and partial, but has refused to cooperate with other countries.

550,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Ukrainian army conduct ceasefire violations,The Ukrainian army has violated the ceasefire in Donbas six times in the last 24 hours on Saturday.,22/07/2019,Italy,Controinformazione,https://www.controinformazione.info/donetsk-lesercito-ucraino-ha-violato-sei-volte-nelle-ultime-24-ore-il-cessate-il-fuoco-instaurato-nel-donbass-sabato/,"<p>The Minsk agreements were concluded as a result of the Ukrainian army defeats in 2014-2015, so they cannot be considered beneficial for Ukraine. Conditionally, the Minsk provisions can be divided into security and political parts.</p>  
<p>Security</p>  
<p>Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.
<p>Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers. In addition, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russia has not implemented an all-for-all exchange, has not provided humanitarian aid through international mechanisms, has not allowed socio-economic ties to be restored and has not fulfilled a bunch of other points.</p> 
<p>Political part</p> 
<p>First, the agreements themselves do not clearly specify the procedure for implementing the provisions. Therefore, Russia cannot claim that Ukraine must first fulfill the political part – to adopt a special status for Donbas and hold local elections.</p> 
<p> Secondly, Russia claims that Ukraine should give Donbas autonomy. Whereas in Minsk it is only a matter of “special status” – not autonomy.</p> 
<p>The special status for Donbas will give the region significant privileges and make the rest of the regions be in an unequal position. Ukraine must also agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections. These elections must be held under Ukrainian law, which is impossible due to the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, Russia has issued its passports to more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, most of whom left ORDLO, is 1.4 million. And most of them will not be able to vote in the election. As a result, Russia has significantly changed the situation in the ORDLO and stepped up its intervention.</p> "

However, the investigators ignored this information.",03/07/2019,Italy,SNA.IT,https://it.sputniknews.com/20190703/tragedia-mh17-discussa-a-osaka-da-premier-dei-paesi-bassi-e-putin-7840331.html,"<p>The Malaysian Boeing over Donbass <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN11Y0WN"">was shot down by Russia</a>  from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system, which was brought from Russia to the territory of Ukraine occupied by the Russian militants. Numerous pieces of evidence <a href=""https://suspilne.media/147713-ricnica-tragedii-mn17-hronika-rozsliduvanna-ta-ucast-ukraini/"">confirm this fact</a>:
About two hours after the crash, one of the militant leaders, Igor Girkin (Strelkov), the “DPR’s” defense minister, published a report that the “DPR” had shot down a Ukrainian AN-26 aircraft near Torez. However, when it became known that it was not a Ukrainian military plane that was shot down, but a passenger plane, Girkin deleted his post.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) <a href=""https://youtu.be/V5E8kDo2n6g"">intercepted</a> conversations of militants on the day of the catastrophe, where terrorists are probably discussing the downing of the Boeing MH17. A version of the downing of the plane from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system was formed on the basis of these conversations.
Independent Bellingcat investigators found that Buk anti-aircraft missile system was transported to the “DPR” from Russia. They confirmed this information with intercepted conversations, satellite photos and social media posts. The Buk which shot down the plane <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/"">belonged</a> to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Army from Kursk.</p> 
<p>The information that the Boeing MH17 was shot down by “DPR” terrorists from the Buk transported from Russia is confirmed by <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN11Y0WN"">the data </a>  of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), led by the Netherlands.</p> 
<p>JIT investigators <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G"">have named</a> four people involved in the downing of a Malaysian Boeing in June 2019. According to the investigation, Igor Girkin, a former “DPR” defense minister, Oleg Pulatov, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian Airborne Forces, Sergey Dubinsky, a retired GRU officer, Leonid Kharchenko, a commander of the intelligence unit at “GRU DPR”, a Ukrainian. The first three suspects at the time of the JIT statement were in Russia, and Kharchenko was in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine. All four are suspect of organizing the supply of anti-aircraft missile system.</p> 
<p>Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shooting down a Boeing and tried to provide its “evidence”. However, all this is a lie. For example, in 2015, Bellingcat journalists used digital satellite images from Globe to <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/06/12/july-17-imagery-mod-comparison/?fbclid=IwAR1MN5oc-0uiQu9NzwkY6HfI1N3VuslUjIKy1YkZWpHSVQcuIkfHxFO4oBM"">expose</a> Russia’s lies about the Malaysian Boeing MH17. Investigators have found that the Russian Defense Ministry published fake photos from space on the day of the catastrophe.</p> 
<p>The Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that MH17 was shot down by a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. It is not true.</p> 
<p>First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17. Experiments confirm that the Su-25 can rise to an altitude of 10,000 km, but without weapons.</p> 
<p>Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17. This was <a href=""https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/krieg-in-der-ukraine-mh-17-wurde-vom-boden-aus-abgeschossen-1.2386385"">stated</a> by one of the designers of the Su-25 Vladimir Babak and the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">editor of the military magazine</a> HS Jane’s Defense Weekly Nick de Larrinaga.</p> 
<p>Third, around 800 pieces of shrapnel <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">had ripped</a> through MH17. This confirms that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, not an air-to-air missile with much less power. Thus, it is impossible to shot down the plane from the Su-25, how Russia stated.</p> 
<p>Russia has called the investigation biased and partial, but has refused to cooperate with other countries. In 2020, Russia <a href=""https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/4387013"">withdrew</a> from consultations with the Netherlands and Australia on the MH17 disaster.</p> "

202,The West controls Ukraine and uses it to its advantage,The West controls the authorities in Ukraine,"Five years have passed since the “orange revolution” in Ukraine, the one that started with the Maidan, led to the Kyiv coup and pushed the Donetsk territories to break away from their homeland in order to preserve Russian identity, which was threatened by the new course of the “puppet” government of Kyiv, remotely controlled by Washington and the security forces group of neoconservatives.",11/04/2019,Italy,Controinformazione,https://www.controinformazione.info/donbass-trincea-deuropa-5-anni-dalla-proclamazione-della-repubblica-di-donetsk-2/,"<p>Ukrainian government authorities independently support domestic and foreign policy.
The decision on state management is praised by internal participants of the political process. Western partners, e.g. the USA, can offer their support, but only the president or other authorized person can decide whether to accept or decline such offer. Moreover, they cannot in any way participate in or direct the electoral process outside their own countries.</p>
<p>The “Orange Revolution” in 2004 rotation of the “Euromaidan”, which later transformed into the “Revolution of Dignity” in 2014 –  is a direct proof of the power of the Ukrainian electorate itself. On the path of peaceful protests, the Ukrainians, in the first place, were able <a href=""https://www.cvk.gov.ua/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2004_osce_pu.pdf"">to carry out an</a> honest election and replace the falsified ones, in the other, to launch systemic reforms to <a href=""https://www.maidanmuseum.org/uk/node/1217"">establish</a>Ukraine as a democratic European state.</p>"

Putin himself mentions it again and again: at the Russian Security Council in January 2021, which preceded the recognition of the LPR and the DPR and the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and at a “meeting” with Aeroflot workers in the spring of 2022, when the Russian military have already carried out active military actions in our territory. We have already refuted this and his other statements in the materials <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/kryve-dzerkalo-rosiiskoi-propagandy/"">“The Crooked Mirror of Russian propaganda.

<p>The Revolution of dignity has absolutely no signs of a <a href=""https://www.maidanmuseum.org/uk/node/1217"">coup d’etat</a>.</p>
<p>The main goal of the coup d’etat is to seize power by conspirators in conformity with their own interests. The Revolution of Dignity began with actions in support of the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU – Euromaidan – and later evolved into mass protests aimed at protecting human and civil rights and freedoms, democratic values. Power and profit have never been its goal. The result of the revolution was the ratification of the Agreement with the EU and the holding of fair presidential and parliamentary elections.</p> 
<p>The conspiracy presupposes the presence of a small group of people and is in no way a mass phenomenon.</p>
<p>According to a <a href=""https://dif.org.ua/article/richnitsya-maydanu-opituvannya-gromadskoi-ta-ekspertnoi-dumki"">sociological  poll</a> conducted in October 2014 by the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation for Democratic Initiatives, about 20% of Ukraine’s population, more than 8.5 million people, took part in peaceful rallies. The poll showed that most citizens perceived participating in the protests as a conscious struggle for their rights.</p> 
<p>Other signs of a coup d’etat are unconstitutionality and violence, when weapons are the main tool to achieve the goal. All the events of the Revolution of Dignity took place in a constitutional manner, and the protesters began to use self-defense only after the escalation of violence by the authorities, which involved armed security forces to disperse unarmed protesters.</p>"

Putin himself mentions it again and again: at the Russian Security Council in January 2021, which preceded the recognition of the LPR and the DPR and the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and at a “meeting” with Aeroflot workers in the spring of 2022, when the Russian military have already carried out active military actions in our territory. We have already refuted this and his other statements in the materials <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/kryve-dzerkalo-rosiiskoi-propagandy/"">“The Crooked Mirror of Russian propaganda. Factcheck of Putin’s New Speech”</a>, <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/golovnyj-brehun-svitu/"">” The World’s Chief Liar”</a> and <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/rada-brekhni-putina-analiz-zasidannya-radbezu-rf/"">”Putin’s Lie Council“. Analysis of the meeting of the Security Council of the Russian Federation”</a>.</p>
<p>The Revolution of dignity has absolutely no signs of a <a href=""https://www.maidanmuseum.org/uk/node/1217"">coup d’etat</a>.</p>
<p>The main goal of the coup d’etat is to seize power by conspirators in conformity with their own interests. The Revolution of Dignity began with actions in support of the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU – Euromaidan – and later evolved into mass protests aimed at protecting human and civil rights and freedoms, democratic values. Power and profit have never been its goal. The result of the revolution was the ratification of the Agreement with the EU and the holding of fair presidential and parliamentary elections.</p> 
<p>The conspiracy presupposes the presence of a small group of people and is in no way a mass phenomenon.</p>
<p>According to a <a href=""https://dif.org.ua/article/richnitsya-maydanu-opituvannya-gromadskoi-ta-ekspertnoi-dumki"">sociological  poll</a> conducted in October 2014 by the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation for Democratic Initiatives, about 20% of Ukraine’s population, more than 8.5 million people, took part in peaceful rallies. The poll showed that most citizens perceived participating in the protests as a conscious struggle for their rights.</p> 
<p>Other signs of a coup d’etat are unconstitutionality and violence, when weapons are the main tool to achieve the goal. All the events of the Revolution of Dignity took place in a constitutional manner, and the protesters began to use self-defense only after the escalation of violence by the authorities, which involved armed security forces to disperse unarmed protesters.</p>"
404,Russia is not an agressor towards Ukraine,Russia did not occupy Crimea. It was a reunification,"Crimea became a Russian region in March 2014, after a referendum in which 96.77% of voters voted for entry into the Russian Federation.     ",15/2/2018,Italy,SNA.IT,https://it.sputniknews.com/20180515/crimeani-vicini-Russia-ucraina-6010638.html,"<p>The decision to hold a so-called “referendum” was made at a session of the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea on February 27, 2014. By then, the military without insignia had already seized the parliament building. Journalists were not allowed into the hall. Whether there was a quorum for making this decision and how the MPs voted under the barrels of guns is unknown. </p>
<p>In 2015, Igor Strelkov (Girkin), a leader in the operation of taking over Crimea, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICgazA79a2g&ab_channel=HalahanValerii"">admitted</a> that the deputies had to be “herded” into the Parliament to vote on February 27.</p>
<p>Two questions were <a href=""http://crimea.gov.ru/act/11689"">put up</a> for the referendum: “Do you support the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation?” and “Do you support the restoration of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea as of 1992 and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?” None of them provided for the possibility of maintaining the status quo. </p>
<p> <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/krym/show/rb076a002-92"">Crimea’s Constitution as of 1992</a> provided broad autonomy rights for the peninsula. As if it were a separate state having its governing bodies and “exercising in its territory all of its powers except those voluntarily delegated to Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The “referendum” was also illegitimate from the point of view of Ukrainian laws. According to Article 73 of Ukraine’s Constitution, the issue of changing the territory is decided only at an all-Ukrainian referendum. Whether Crimea should be part of Ukraine had to be agreed upon by all the regions, and the voting of people in Crimea alone was not enough for such a decision.</p>
<p>In truth, the Crimean “referendum” took place without international observers who could document violations. However, Crimean journalists and voters have repeatedly <a href=""https://crimea.suspilne.media/ua/articles/45""> stated</a>  that ballots were distributed in a massive way to the same people. They were also given to people with Russian passports.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Venice Commission unanimously adopted an  <a href=""https://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2014)002-e"">opinion</a> viewing the referendum in Crimea as unlawful and violating, besides the Constitution of Ukraine, basic international principles regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty of subjects of international law.</p>
<p>Neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor the United States recognized the results of Crimea’s “referendum.” On March 27, 2021, <a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464812-backing-ukraines-territorial-integrity-un-assembly-declares-crimea-referendum"">passed</a> a resolution to support Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

<p>Data on the number of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are regularly published on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.

Instead, OSCE SMM reports during this period revealed the systemic restrictions on freedom of movement in the temporarily occupied territories (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505267"">for example, here</a>), blocking of communications and surveillance (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505276"">here</a>), threats to the personal security of international observers by Russian armed forces (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/512884"">here</a>)</p>

<p>In March 2014, there were rallies in Donetsk and Luhansk: in favor of joining Russia and uniting with Ukraine. Local witnesses said people had been brought from the Russian border to participate in pro-Russian rallies.</p> 
<p>In April, armed men (local and Russian citizens) began to capture city authorities in the Donbas region. According to a Radio Liberty <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/31380909.html"">investigation</a>, Russian army officers led the operations. The separatists proclaimed the so-called “DPR” on April 7, 2014, and the “LPR” on April 27, 2014.</p>

They opened fire from the occupied territories of Ukraine and Russia.</p>  
<p> However, they failed to stop the Armed Forces’ offensive. The Kremlin sent 4,000 regular army soldiers to Donbas in August 2014, an Atlantic Council <a href=""https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/191186/HPS_RW_Russian_0713_final_web.pdf"">report</a> said.

<p> In February 2014, the same Verkhovna Rada that had operated under fugitive president Viktor Yanukovych (not the “West”) appointed the new government.</p> 
<p>After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power. Based on this, it appointed Oleksandr Turchynov President of Ukraine, on February 23.

<p>In December 2021, Russian politicians, including President Putin and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, claimed that Ukraine had moved half of its army (or 120,000 to 125,000 troops) to the war zone. They did not release any confirmation of the mentioned data.</p>
<p>Data on the number of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are regularly published on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The information is also available in the passports of budget programs exposed for public access. In December 2021, there were more than 201,000 servicemen in the Armed Forces. Just over 40,000 of them took part in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). That is three times less than what was said in Russia. For comparison, in February 2021, just over 40,000 servicemen took part in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). Almost a year before, in May 2020 there had been the same number – 40 thousand.</p>
<p>The number of Ukrainian servicemen in Donbas did not increase. Instead, in October-November 2021, Russia, according to various estimates, drew about 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s borders.
There is no evidence, in particular from independent observers, that Kyiv was going to attack Donbas</p>
<p>In the autumn of 2021, Russia once again declared that Ukraine was preparing for the “offensive in Donbas.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation announced offensive actions of the Armed Forces in the area of ​​Granitny and Staromaryivka (Donetsk region), referring to the reports of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.
This is not true: the Mission’s daily reports did not mention this. Instead, OSCE SMM reports during this period revealed the systemic restrictions on freedom of movement in the temporarily occupied territories (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505267"">for example, here</a>), blocking of communications and surveillance (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/505276"">here</a>), threats to the personal security of international observers by Russian armed forces (<a href=""https://www.osce.org/uk/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/512884"">here</a>)</p>
<p>The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not open fire first and do not shell civilians and infrastructure in Donbas</p>
<p>The Ukrainian Armed Forces first used the Turkish Bayraktar drone in October 2021. The parties have banned the use of UAVs in the context of a truce signed in July 2020 within the Tripartite Contact Group. The first paragraph states a “ban on the use of any type of aircraft.” But there is also a ban on any “use of fire, including sniper fire” – and this point is constantly being neglected by the Russian occupation forces.</p>
<p>Bayraktar was used as a last resort. The militants fired from 122-mm howitzers prohibited by the Minsk agreements on civilian targets and positions of the Armed Forces near Granitny in the Donetsk region for several days. In addition, Russian mercenaries dropped explosive devices with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle.</p>
<p>The militants did not stop the shelling even after the Ukrainian side used a standard response mechanism: the OSCE SMM called for a ceasefire. And under the terms of the July 2020 truce, retaliatory fire is allowed in the event of a failed response.
Ukraine did not violate the Minsk agreements: Bayraktar did not cross the contact line, the howitzer was destroyed by a guided missile.</p>
<p>In addition, the first drones in Donbas were, in fact, used by militants: Russian UAVs “Orlan-10” <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sergiy.garmash/posts/3854732251293562"">have long been recorded</a> in Donbas.</p>

By then, the military without insignia had already seized the parliament building. Journalists were not allowed into the hall. Whether there was a quorum for making this decision and how the MPs voted under the barrels of guns is unknown. </p>
<p>In 2015, Igor Strelkov (Girkin), a leader in the operation of taking over Crimea, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICgazA79a2g&ab_channel=HalahanValerii"">admitted</a> that the deputies had to be “herded” into the Parliament to vote on February 27.</p>
<p>Two questions were <a href=""http://crimea.gov.ru/act/11689"">put up</a> for the referendum: “Do you support the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation?” and “Do you support the restoration of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea as of 1992 and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?” None of them provided for the possibility of maintaining the status quo. </p>
<p> <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/krym/show/rb076a002-92"">Crimea’s Constitution as of 1992</a> provided broad autonomy rights for the peninsula. As if it were a separate state having its governing bodies and “exercising in its territory all of its powers except those voluntarily delegated to Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The “referendum” was also illegitimate from the point of view of Ukrainian laws. According to Article 73 of Ukraine’s Constitution, the issue of changing the territory is decided only at an all-Ukrainian referendum. Whether Crimea should be part of Ukraine had to be agreed upon by all the regions, and the voting of people in Crimea alone was not enough for such a decision.</p>
<p>In truth, the Crimean “referendum” took place without international observers who could document violations. However, Crimean journalists and voters have repeatedly <a href=""https://crimea.suspilne.media/ua/articles/45""> stated</a>  that ballots were distributed in a massive way to the same people. They were also given to people with Russian passports.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Venice Commission unanimously adopted an  <a href=""https://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2014)002-e"">opinion</a> viewing the referendum in Crimea as unlawful and violating, besides the Constitution of Ukraine, basic international principles regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty of subjects of international law.</p>
<p>Neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor the United States recognized the results of Crimea’s “referendum.” On March 27, 2021, <a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464812-backing-ukraines-territorial-integrity-un-assembly-declares-crimea-referendum"">passed</a> a resolution to support Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

These entities do not provide any evidence of their claims. They are also not confirmed by the data of international observers, namely the OSCE Specialized Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.</p>  
<p>Or they distort the data in the OSCE SMM reports. For example, in April 2021, propagandists reported that a child had died in the Donbas as a result of the Ukrainian drone attack. The mission <a href=""https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/482927"">confirmed</a> the child’s death “as a result of an explosive injury and multiple shrapnel wounds.” There is no information that the child died as a result of a drone strike. And the village of Oleksandrivske, where the incident took place, is in the deep rear of the militants – a drone of the Armed Forces of Ukraine simply could not reach it.</p>
<p>In other cases, the militants referred to the JCCC – Joint Center for Control and Coordination on ceasefire and stabilization of the demarcation line. It was organized in 2014 with the participation of the Ukrainian and Russian military.</p>
<p>But at the end of 2017, Russia withdrew from the JCCC due to new entry rules for Russian officers. Their places in the territories not controlled by Ukraine were taken by militants of the so-called “LDPR”, so their messages cannot be called impartial. Ukraine does not recognize the representatives of the self-proclaimed “republics” as part of the Joint Center, and the EU has called on Russia to <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/9/9/469707.pdf"">return</a> its officers to the JCCC.</p>
<p>In most cases, the ceasefire is violated by Russian occupation forces</p>
<p>On July 27, 2020, the agreement on the establishment of a full and comprehensive ceasefire in Donbas went into effect. Russia claims that Ukraine, ostensibly, does not abide by the terms of the ceasefire. This is not true: the OSCE SMM data proves the opposite. For example, reports for 2021:
in <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/4/1/485378.pdf"">January-March</a>, 98% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control;
in <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/0/0/495784.pdf"">April-June</a>, 93% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control;
in <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/0/0/504544.pdf"">July-September</a>, 87% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control.</p>
<p>The forced evacuation of civilians, which the militants announced in the territories of the so-called “LPR” and “DPR” on February 18, 2021, was a pre-planned operation. According to metadata, a video with “LPR leader” Leonid Pasichnyk about the evacuation was recorded at least two days before its publication on February 16. The video of DNR leader Denis Pushylin with a similar appeal was also recorded on February 16. That is, even before “Ukraine launched an attack” according to Russia.</p>
<p>All this indicates that the reasons for the “evacuation” of the population were invented in advance. Meanwhile, the militants rejected the offer of the Ukrainian side to hold an extraordinary meeting of the Tripartite Contact Group – a group of representatives from Ukraine, the OSCE and Russia, formed for a diplomatic solution to the war in Donbas.</p>"

Putin himself mentions it again and again: at the Russian Security Council in January 2021, which preceded the recognition of the LPR and the DPR and the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and at a “meeting” with Aeroflot workers in the spring of 2022, when the Russian military have already carried out active military actions in our territory. We have already refuted this and his other statements in the materials <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/kryve-dzerkalo-rosiiskoi-propagandy/"">“The Crooked Mirror of Russian propaganda. Factcheck of Putin’s New Speech”</a>, <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/golovnyj-brehun-svitu/"">” The World’s Chief Liar”</a> and <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/rada-brekhni-putina-analiz-zasidannya-radbezu-rf/"">”Putin’s Lie Council“.

<p>The Revolution of dignity has absolutely no signs of a <a href=""https://www.maidanmuseum.org/uk/node/1217"">coup d’etat</a>.</p>
<p>The main goal of the coup d’etat is to seize power by conspirators in conformity with their own interests. The Revolution of Dignity began with actions in support of the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU – Euromaidan – and later evolved into mass protests aimed at protecting human and civil rights and freedoms, democratic values. Power and profit have never been its goal. The result of the revolution was the ratification of the Agreement with the EU and the holding of fair presidential and parliamentary elections.</p> 
<p>The conspiracy presupposes the presence of a small group of people and is in no way a mass phenomenon.</p>
<p>According to a <a href=""https://dif.org.ua/article/richnitsya-maydanu-opituvannya-gromadskoi-ta-ekspertnoi-dumki"">sociological  poll</a> conducted in October 2014 by the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation for Democratic Initiatives, about 20% of Ukraine’s population, more than 8.5 million people, took part in peaceful rallies. The poll showed that most citizens perceived participating in the protests as a conscious struggle for their rights.</p> 
<p>Other signs of a coup d’etat are unconstitutionality and violence, when weapons are the main tool to achieve the goal. All the events of the Revolution of Dignity took place in a constitutional manner, and the protesters began to use self-defense only after the escalation of violence by the authorities, which involved armed security forces to disperse unarmed protesters.</p>"

<p>On July 27, 2020, the agreement on the establishment of a full and comprehensive ceasefire in Donbas went into effect. Russia claims that Ukraine, ostensibly, does not abide by the terms of the ceasefire. This is not true: the OSCE SMM data proves the opposite. For example, reports for 2021:
in <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/4/1/485378.pdf"">January-March</a>, 98% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control;
in <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/0/0/495784.pdf"">April-June</a>, 93% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control;
in <a href=""https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/0/0/504544.pdf"">July-September</a>, 87% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control.</p>
<p>The forced evacuation of civilians, which the militants announced in the territories of the so-called “LPR” and “DPR” on February 18, 2021, was a pre-planned operation. According to metadata, a video with “LPR leader” Leonid Pasichnyk about the evacuation was recorded at least two days before its publication on February 16. The video of DNR leader Denis Pushylin with a similar appeal was also recorded on February 16. That is, even before “Ukraine launched an attack” according to Russia.</p>
<p>All this indicates that the reasons for the “evacuation” of the population were invented in advance. Meanwhile, the militants rejected the offer of the Ukrainian side to hold an extraordinary meeting of the Tripartite Contact Group – a group of representatives from Ukraine, the OSCE and Russia, formed for a diplomatic solution to the war in Donbas.</p>"

554,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Ukraine denounced Minsk Agreements,"Ukraine finally refuses to implement the Minsk agreements — Miroshnik
The instruction of the Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Valery Zalutzhny to allow the use of any kind of weapons to shell Donbas shows that Ukraine has finally abandoned the Minsk agreements, said LNR representative in the Trilateral Contact Group (TCG) Rodion Miroshnik.",29/09/2021,Germany,Newsfront,https://de.news-front.info/2021/09/29/ukraine-weigert-sich-endgultig-die-minsker-vereinbarungen-umzusetzen-miroschnik/,"<p>Neither the Ukrainian government nor the parliament has ever announced its withdrawal from the Minsk agreements</p>  
<p>Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has consistently emphasized that Ukraine is not renouncing the Minsk agreements. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has never said that the Minsk agreements are invalid. Moreover, in December 2021, he announced that Ukraine had developed a 10-step plan for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements and passed it on to the United States, Germany, France and Russia.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2268-19#Text"">law</a> on the reintegration of Donbas, adopted in 2018, does not mention the Minsk agreements at all, especially the refusal to comply with them.</p> 
<p>It (the Law “On the peculiarities of state policy to ensure the state sovereignty of Ukraine in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions”) states that Ukraine was attacked by Russia, which is the aggressor and occupier, and the part of the Donbas is occupied by it. And the illegal armed groups “LPR” and “DPR”, which actually control the occupied territories, are “representatives of the occupation administrations of Russia.” The law does not contradict the provisions of the Minsk agreements. But, of course, Russia cannot like it, hiding its participation in the war in Donbas.</p> 
<p>Ukraine did not report withdrawing from the Minsk agreements shortly before Russia’s full-scale attack.</p> 
<p>Propaganda resources misrepresented the content of the quote from Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the head of the President’s Office. After the meeting of Volodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden in September 2021, Arestovych told one of the Ukrainian TV channels that the parties had agreed on the possibility of modernizing the Minsk agreements. And he addressed the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Lavrov with the words: “Mr. Lavrov, my best regards to you: we are off the hook of the Minsk agreements.” Shortly before that, Lavrov said that “Russia will not allow Zelensky and Ukraine to” get off the hook of the Minsk agreements“.</p> 
<p>Later, Oleksiy Arestovych said that “the Minsk agreements haven’t vanished”, the parties did not announce their withdrawal. He spoke only about the interpretation of the agreements required by Russia: “Well, the news for Lavrov is that the hook of the Minsk agreements no longer exists. Nor the Minsk agreements, namely the hook of the Minsk agreements, that is, the Russian version of their interpretation, which they tried to impose on us and the world community“.</p> 
<p>In fact it is Russia, which does not fulfill most of the statements of the Minsk agreements
This was the reason for  the EU <a href=""https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/01/13/Russia-eu-renews-economic-sanctions-over-the-situation-in-ukraine-for-further-six-months/"">extending</a> sanctions against Russia in January 2022.
Russia blocks OSCE observers from accessing certain areas and does not provide humanitarian aid through international mechanisms. Russia does not comply with the security provisions of the Minsk agreements: a ceasefire, complete withdrawal of pro-Russian militants and Russian weapons from Ukraine.</p> 
<p> At the same time, Russia claims that it is not a party in the Minsk agreements and is not mentioned in the text. But these documents were signed by Russia’s representative Mikhail Zubarov.</p> 
<p>Russia is trying to force Ukraine to implement “Minsk” on its own terms.

According to a Radio Liberty <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/31380909.html"">investigation</a>, Russian army officers led the operations.

They opened fire from the occupied territories of Ukraine and Russia.</p>  
<p> However, they failed to stop the Armed Forces’ offensive. The Kremlin sent 4,000 regular army soldiers to Donbas in August 2014, an Atlantic Council <a href=""https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/191186/HPS_RW_Russian_0713_final_web.pdf"">report</a> said.

<p>After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power. Based on this, it appointed Oleksandr Turchynov President of Ukraine, on February 23.

Numerous pieces of evidence <a href=""https://suspilne.media/147713-ricnica-tragedii-mn17-hronika-rozsliduvanna-ta-ucast-ukraini/"">confirm this fact</a>:
About two hours after the crash, one of the militant leaders, Igor Girkin (Strelkov), the “DPR’s” defense minister, published a report that the “DPR” had shot down a Ukrainian AN-26 aircraft near Torez. However, when it became known that it was not a Ukrainian military plane that was shot down, but a passenger plane, Girkin deleted his post.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) <a href=""https://youtu.be/V5E8kDo2n6g"">intercepted</a> conversations of militants on the day of the catastrophe, where terrorists are probably discussing the downing of the Boeing MH17. A version of the downing of the plane from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system was formed on the basis of these conversations.
Independent Bellingcat investigators found that Buk anti-aircraft missile system was transported to the “DPR” from Russia. They confirmed this information with intercepted conversations, satellite photos and social media posts. The Buk which shot down the plane <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/"">belonged</a> to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Army from Kursk.</p> 
<p>The information that the Boeing MH17 was shot down by “DPR” terrorists from the Buk transported from Russia is confirmed by <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN11Y0WN"">the data </a>  of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), led by the Netherlands.</p> 
<p>JIT investigators <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G"">have named</a> four people involved in the downing of a Malaysian Boeing in June 2019. According to the investigation, Igor Girkin, a former “DPR” defense minister, Oleg Pulatov, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian Airborne Forces, Sergey Dubinsky, a retired GRU officer, Leonid Kharchenko, a commander of the intelligence unit at “GRU DPR”, a Ukrainian. The first three suspects at the time of the JIT statement were in Russia, and Kharchenko was in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine. All four are suspect of organizing the supply of anti-aircraft missile system.</p> 
<p>Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shooting down a Boeing and tried to provide its “evidence”. However, all this is a lie. For example, in 2015, Bellingcat journalists used digital satellite images from Globe to <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/06/12/july-17-imagery-mod-comparison/?fbclid=IwAR1MN5oc-0uiQu9NzwkY6HfI1N3VuslUjIKy1YkZWpHSVQcuIkfHxFO4oBM"">expose</a> Russia’s lies about the Malaysian Boeing MH17. Investigators have found that the Russian Defense Ministry published fake photos from space on the day of the catastrophe.</p> 
<p>The Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that MH17 was shot down by a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. It is not true.</p> 
<p>First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17. Experiments confirm that the Su-25 can rise to an altitude of 10,000 km, but without weapons.</p> 
<p>Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17. This was <a href=""https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/krieg-in-der-ukraine-mh-17-wurde-vom-boden-aus-abgeschossen-1.2386385"">stated</a> by one of the designers of the Su-25 Vladimir Babak and the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">editor of the military magazine</a> HS Jane’s Defense Weekly Nick de Larrinaga.</p> 
<p>Third, around 800 pieces of shrapnel <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">had ripped</a> through MH17. This confirms that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, not an air-to-air missile with much less power. Thus, it is impossible to shot down the plane from the Su-25, how Russia stated.</p> 
<p>Russia has called the investigation biased and partial, but has refused to cooperate with other countries. In 2020, Russia <a href=""https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/4387013"">withdrew</a> from consultations with the Netherlands and Australia on the MH17 disaster.</p> "

<p>According to a Bellingcat <a href=""https://ru.bellingcat.com/novosti/ukraine/2016/12/21/putins-undeclared-war-summer-2014-Russian-artillery-strikes-against-ukraine/"">investigation</a>, military units liquidated all Ukrainian authorities in the occupied territories in April and May and began shelling Ukrainian cities with heavy artillery. They opened fire from the occupied territories of Ukraine and Russia.</p>  
<p> However, they failed to stop the Armed Forces’ offensive. The Kremlin sent 4,000 regular army soldiers to Donbas in August 2014, an Atlantic Council <a href=""https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/191186/HPS_RW_Russian_0713_final_web.pdf"">report</a> said.

The Russian military took an active part in the fighting, and their intervention turned the tide of the battle.</p>  
<p>According to Ukrainian intelligence reports, at least <a href=""https://www.radiosvoboda.org/amp/donbas-realii/29721302.html?fbclid=IwAR0DxGV2Tt6r_TGZz2VihZAiNdc7cdwrw6QWrODSBpo4VX6Kp2AKZKJl0ro"">11 Russian generals</a> commanded the “troops” made up of the DNR and LNR groups.</p> 
<p> In February 2014, the same Verkhovna Rada that had operated under fugitive president Viktor Yanukovych (not the “West”) appointed the new government.</p> 
<p>After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/757-18"">resolution</a> saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power. Based on this, it appointed Oleksandr Turchynov President of Ukraine, on February 23. The then convocation of Verkhovna Rada <a href=""https://www.kmu.gov.ua/news/247059910"">voted</a> for the new government and prime minister on February 27. Therefore, the Ukrainian government’s “illegitimacy” is a Russian propaganda myth.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian military in the East is at war with militants whom Russia supplies with Russian troops and weapons.</p> 
<p>Evidence of Russian troops and military equipment in Donbas is plentiful. We will provide it in this <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/rosiya-ne-ye-agresorom-shhodo-ukrayiny-oglyad-italijskyh-ta-nimetskyh-prorosijskyh-zmi/#_ftn1"">article</a>.</p> "
576,Ukraine is conducting an aggressive policy,Kyiv ignores fulfillment ot the Minsk Agreements,"But even after the ceasefire was signed, there were repeated exchanges of gunfire in the region. Fire attacks by Ukrainian heavy artillery on residential areas were reported from the Donetsk People's Republic. Moscow has repeatedly stated that Kyiv is not fulfilling the Minsk agreements and is delaying negotiations on the settlement of the conflict.",26/12/2021,Germany,SNA.DE,https://snanews.de/20211226/buergerkriegserweiterung-im-donbass-voellig-unzulaessig--kreml-4818628.html,"<p>The Minsk agreements were concluded as a result of the Ukrainian army defeats in 2014-2015, so they cannot be considered beneficial for Ukraine. Conditionally, the Minsk provisions can be divided into security and political parts.</p>  
<p>Security</p>  
<p>Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.
<p>Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers. In addition, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russia has not implemented an all-for-all exchange, has not provided humanitarian aid through international mechanisms, has not allowed socio-economic ties to be restored and has not fulfilled a bunch of other points.</p> 
<p>Political part</p> 
<p>First, the agreements themselves do not clearly specify the procedure for implementing the provisions. Therefore, Russia cannot claim that Ukraine must first fulfill the political part – to adopt a special status for Donbas and hold local elections.</p> 
<p> Secondly, Russia claims that Ukraine should give Donbas autonomy. Whereas in Minsk it is only a matter of “special status” – not autonomy.</p> 
<p>The special status for Donbas will give the region significant privileges and make the rest of the regions be in an unequal position. Ukraine must also agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections. These elections must be held under Ukrainian law, which is impossible due to the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, Russia has issued its passports to more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, most of whom left ORDLO, is 1.4 million. And most of them will not be able to vote in the election. As a result, Russia has significantly changed the situation in the ORDLO and stepped up its intervention.</p> "

Numerous pieces of evidence <a href=""https://suspilne.media/147713-ricnica-tragedii-mn17-hronika-rozsliduvanna-ta-ucast-ukraini/"">confirm this fact</a>:
About two hours after the crash, one of the militant leaders, Igor Girkin (Strelkov), the “DPR’s” defense minister, published a report that the “DPR” had shot down a Ukrainian AN-26 aircraft near Torez. However, when it became known that it was not a Ukrainian military plane that was shot down, but a passenger plane, Girkin deleted his post.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) <a href=""https://youtu.be/V5E8kDo2n6g"">intercepted</a> conversations of militants on the day of the catastrophe, where terrorists are probably discussing the downing of the Boeing MH17. A version of the downing of the plane from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system was formed on the basis of these conversations.
Independent Bellingcat investigators found that Buk anti-aircraft missile system was transported to the “DPR” from Russia. They confirmed this information with intercepted conversations, satellite photos and social media posts. The Buk which shot down the plane <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/"">belonged</a> to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Army from Kursk.</p> 
<p>The information that the Boeing MH17 was shot down by “DPR” terrorists from the Buk transported from Russia is confirmed by <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN11Y0WN"">the data </a>  of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), led by the Netherlands.</p> 
<p>JIT investigators <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G"">have named</a> four people involved in the downing of a Malaysian Boeing in June 2019. According to the investigation, Igor Girkin, a former “DPR” defense minister, Oleg Pulatov, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian Airborne Forces, Sergey Dubinsky, a retired GRU officer, Leonid Kharchenko, a commander of the intelligence unit at “GRU DPR”, a Ukrainian. The first three suspects at the time of the JIT statement were in Russia, and Kharchenko was in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine. All four are suspect of organizing the supply of anti-aircraft missile system.</p> 
<p>Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shooting down a Boeing and tried to provide its “evidence”. However, all this is a lie. For example, in 2015, Bellingcat journalists used digital satellite images from Globe to <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/06/12/july-17-imagery-mod-comparison/?fbclid=IwAR1MN5oc-0uiQu9NzwkY6HfI1N3VuslUjIKy1YkZWpHSVQcuIkfHxFO4oBM"">expose</a> Russia’s lies about the Malaysian Boeing MH17. Investigators have found that the Russian Defense Ministry published fake photos from space on the day of the catastrophe.</p> 
<p>The Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that MH17 was shot down by a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. It is not true.</p> 
<p>First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17. Experiments confirm that the Su-25 can rise to an altitude of 10,000 km, but without weapons.</p> 
<p>Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17. This was <a href=""https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/krieg-in-der-ukraine-mh-17-wurde-vom-boden-aus-abgeschossen-1.2386385"">stated</a> by one of the designers of the Su-25 Vladimir Babak and the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">editor of the military magazine</a> HS Jane’s Defense Weekly Nick de Larrinaga.</p> 
<p>Third, around 800 pieces of shrapnel <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">had ripped</a> through MH17. This confirms that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, not an air-to-air missile with much less power. Thus, it is impossible to shot down the plane from the Su-25, how Russia stated.</p> 
<p>Russia has called the investigation biased and partial, but has refused to cooperate with other countries. In 2020, Russia <a href=""https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/4387013"">withdrew</a> from consultations with the Netherlands and Australia on the MH17 disaster.</p> "

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) <a href=""https://youtu.be/V5E8kDo2n6g"">intercepted</a> conversations of militants on the day of the catastrophe, where terrorists are probably discussing the downing of the Boeing MH17. A version of the downing of the plane from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system was formed on the basis of these conversations.
Independent Bellingcat investigators found that Buk anti-aircraft missile system was transported to the “DPR” from Russia. They confirmed this information with intercepted conversations, satellite photos and social media posts. The Buk which shot down the plane <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/"">belonged</a> to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Army from Kursk.</p>

<p>JIT investigators <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G"">have named</a> four people involved in the downing of a Malaysian Boeing in June 2019. According to the investigation, Igor Girkin, a former “DPR” defense minister, Oleg Pulatov, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian Airborne Forces, Sergey Dubinsky, a retired GRU officer, Leonid Kharchenko, a commander of the intelligence unit at “GRU DPR”, a Ukrainian. The first three suspects at the time of the JIT statement were in Russia, and Kharchenko was in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine. All four are suspect of organizing the supply of anti-aircraft missile system.</p> 
<p>Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shooting down a Boeing and tried to provide its “evidence”. However, all this is a lie. For example, in 2015, Bellingcat journalists used digital satellite images from Globe to <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/06/12/july-17-imagery-mod-comparison/?fbclid=IwAR1MN5oc-0uiQu9NzwkY6HfI1N3VuslUjIKy1YkZWpHSVQcuIkfHxFO4oBM"">expose</a> Russia’s lies about the Malaysian Boeing MH17. Investigators have found that the Russian Defense Ministry published fake photos from space on the day of the catastrophe.</p> 
<p>The Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that MH17 was shot down by a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. It is not true.</p> 
<p>First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17. Experiments confirm that the Su-25 can rise to an altitude of 10,000 km, but without weapons.</p> 
<p>Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17. This was <a href=""https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/krieg-in-der-ukraine-mh-17-wurde-vom-boden-aus-abgeschossen-1.2386385"">stated</a> by one of the designers of the Su-25 Vladimir Babak and the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">editor of the military magazine</a> HS Jane’s Defense Weekly Nick de Larrinaga.</p> 
<p>Third, around 800 pieces of shrapnel <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">had ripped</a> through MH17. This confirms that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, not an air-to-air missile with much less power.

<p>First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17. Experiments confirm that the Su-25 can rise to an altitude of 10,000 km, but without weapons.</p> 
<p>Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17.

A version of the downing of the plane from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system was formed on the basis of these conversations.
Independent Bellingcat investigators found that Buk anti-aircraft missile system was transported to the “DPR” from Russia.

<p>JIT investigators <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-mh17-idUSKCN1TJ30G"">have named</a> four people involved in the downing of a Malaysian Boeing in June 2019.

<p>The Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that MH17 was shot down by a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. It is not true.</p> 
<p>First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17. Experiments confirm that the Su-25 can rise to an altitude of 10,000 km, but without weapons.</p> 
<p>Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17.

<p>The Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that MH17 was shot down by a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. It is not true.</p> 
<p>First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17. Experiments confirm that the Su-25 can rise to an altitude of 10,000 km, but without weapons.</p> 
<p>Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17. This was <a href=""https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/krieg-in-der-ukraine-mh-17-wurde-vom-boden-aus-abgeschossen-1.2386385"">stated</a> by one of the designers of the Su-25 Vladimir Babak and the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">editor of the military magazine</a> HS Jane’s Defense Weekly Nick de Larrinaga.</p> 
<p>Third, around 800 pieces of shrapnel <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35706048"">had ripped</a> through MH17. This confirms that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, not an air-to-air missile with much less power. Thus, it is impossible to shot down the plane from the Su-25, how Russia stated.</p> 
<p>Russia has called the investigation biased and partial, but has refused to cooperate with other countries. In 2020, Russia <a href=""https://www.mid.ru/ru/foreign_policy/news/-/asset_publisher/cKNonkJE02Bw/content/id/4387013"">withdrew</a> from consultations with the Netherlands and Australia on the MH17 disaster.</p> "
40,Maidan in 2014 was a coup d'état,Maidan in 2014 was a coup d'état,in Ukraine we have witnessed a real coup d'état,18/03/2014,Italy,Viva.it,http://www.vita.it/it/article/2014/03/18/cosa-e-successo-a-piazza-maidan-la-vera-storia-della-rivolta-ucraina/126393/,"<p>Allegations of an alleged coup d’etat in the downtown of Kyiv are typical rhetoric of the Kremlin, which thus justifies its own aggression. Putin himself mentions it again and again: at the Russian Security Council in January 2021, which preceded the recognition of the LPR and the DPR and the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and at a “meeting” with Aeroflot workers in the spring of 2022, when the Russian military have already carried out active military actions in our territory. We have already refuted this and his other statements in the materials <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/kryve-dzerkalo-rosiiskoi-propagandy/"">“The Crooked Mirror of Russian propaganda. Factcheck of Putin’s New Speech”</a>, <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/golovnyj-brehun-svitu/"">” The World’s Chief Liar”</a> and <a href=""https://voxukraine.org/rada-brekhni-putina-analiz-zasidannya-radbezu-rf/"">”Putin’s Lie Council“. Analysis of the meeting of the Security Council of the Russian Federation”</a>.</p>
<p>The Revolution of dignity has absolutely no signs of a <a href=""https://www.maidanmuseum.org/uk/node/1217"">coup d’etat</a>.</p>
<p>The main goal of the coup d’etat is to seize power by conspirators in conformity with their own interests. The Revolution of Dignity began with actions in support of the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU – Euromaidan – and later evolved into mass protests aimed at protecting human and civil rights and freedoms, democratic values. Power and profit have never been its goal. The result of the revolution was the ratification of the Agreement with the EU and the holding of fair presidential and parliamentary elections.</p> 
<p>The conspiracy presupposes the presence of a small group of people and is in no way a mass phenomenon.</p>
<p>According to a <a href=""https://dif.org.ua/article/richnitsya-maydanu-opituvannya-gromadskoi-ta-ekspertnoi-dumki"">sociological  poll</a> conducted in October 2014 by the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation for Democratic Initiatives, about 20% of Ukraine’s population, more than 8.5 million people, took part in peaceful rallies. The poll showed that most citizens perceived participating in the protests as a conscious struggle for their rights.</p> 
<p>Other signs of a coup d’etat are unconstitutionality and violence, when weapons are the main tool to achieve the goal. All the events of the Revolution of Dignity took place in a constitutional manner, and the protesters began to use self-defense only after the escalation of violence by the authorities, which involved armed security forces to disperse unarmed protesters.</p>"
400,Russia is not an agressor towards Ukraine,Russia did not occupy Crimea. It was a reunification,"In Sunday's referendum, 96.6 percent of Crimes, equal to 1.2 million people, voted in favor of reunification with Russia. ",17/3/2014,Italy,avvenire.it,https://www.avvenire.it/mondo/pagine/referendum-crimea-96-per-cento-a-favore-della-Russia,"<p>The decision to hold a so-called “referendum” was made at a session of the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea on February 27, 2014. By then, the military without insignia had already seized the parliament building. Journalists were not allowed into the hall. Whether there was a quorum for making this decision and how the MPs voted under the barrels of guns is unknown. </p>
<p>In 2015, Igor Strelkov (Girkin), a leader in the operation of taking over Crimea, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICgazA79a2g&ab_channel=HalahanValerii"">admitted</a> that the deputies had to be “herded” into the Parliament to vote on February 27.</p>
<p>Two questions were <a href=""http://crimea.gov.ru/act/11689"">put up</a> for the referendum: “Do you support the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation?” and “Do you support the restoration of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea as of 1992 and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?” None of them provided for the possibility of maintaining the status quo. </p>
<p> <a href=""https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/krym/show/rb076a002-92"">Crimea’s Constitution as of 1992</a> provided broad autonomy rights for the peninsula. As if it were a separate state having its governing bodies and “exercising in its territory all of its powers except those voluntarily delegated to Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The “referendum” was also illegitimate from the point of view of Ukrainian laws. According to Article 73 of Ukraine’s Constitution, the issue of changing the territory is decided only at an all-Ukrainian referendum. Whether Crimea should be part of Ukraine had to be agreed upon by all the regions, and the voting of people in Crimea alone was not enough for such a decision.</p>
<p>In truth, the Crimean “referendum” took place without international observers who could document violations. However, Crimean journalists and voters have repeatedly <a href=""https://crimea.suspilne.media/ua/articles/45""> stated</a>  that ballots were distributed in a massive way to the same people. They were also given to people with Russian passports.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Venice Commission unanimously adopted an  <a href=""https://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD(2014)002-e"">opinion</a> viewing the referendum in Crimea as unlawful and violating, besides the Constitution of Ukraine, basic international principles regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty of subjects of international law.</p>
<p>Neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor the United States recognized the results of Crimea’s “referendum.” On March 27, 2021, <a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2014/03/464812-backing-ukraines-territorial-integrity-un-assembly-declares-crimea-referendum"">passed</a> a resolution to support Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The European Union <a href=""https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/02/25/ukraine-declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-european-union-on-the-illegal-annexation-of-crimea-and-sevastopol/"">adheres to</a> a strict policy of not recognizing illegitimate “referendum” results. Economic sanctions the EU <a href=""https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/sanctions/ukraine-crisis/"">imposed</a> on Russia after the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas have not been lifted since 2014.</p>"

The Ukrainian authorities are independently responsible for their domestic and foreign policy. Western countries support us, but do not force us to make any changes.</p>

208,The West controls Ukraine and uses it to its advantage,Ukrainian coup d'etat (Maidan) in 2014 was supported or organized by the West," ""MADE IN USA"" COUP STRATEGY…the US has invested $5 billion in destabilizing Ukraine.",23/02/2014,Italy,Controinformazione,https://www.controinformazione.info/strategia-del-golpe-made-in-usa/,"<p>First, the events of 2014 in Ukraine are not a coup d’etat. Allegations of a coup in central Kyiv are typical for the Kremlin’s rhetoric, which justifies its own aggression.</p>
<p>A coup d’etat is an unconstitutional seizure of power by a small group of individuals, conspirators acting in their own interests. The revolution of dignity began with peaceful protests by unarmed people in support of democratization, which the authorities tried to suppress by force, forcing them to use self-defense, and was massive.
